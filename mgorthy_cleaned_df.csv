R2WMIQOXTJA88Q,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Earphones you will ever buy...,Mike,5,"These are probably the best Bluetooth earbuds I have ever bought. There is one bug, but it is very easy to fix and it rarely happens. Occasionally (I am saying like once every 3 months), the earbuds will disconnect from my device and stop playing sound. The easy fix is to turn off Bluetooth and turn it back on. I have read reviews of similar occurrences and people are thinking it is Bluetooth interference. I do not think that is what it is. Just happens randomly. I use them every day and sometimes I lose connection with no other Bluetooth devices around. But other than one small bug, these earbuds rock! I will use one earbud at a time and rotate them when one earbud is low. Each earbud lasts about 9 hours and the base charges an additional 24 hours, which means I make my earbuds last about 42 hours. Bluetooth range is excellent. Sound quality is excellent. Does get loud but it does not completely cancel out sound (like a vacuum running). Earbuds are very relaxing on the ears and I wear them all day. Works with my 2 computers, Windows and Chromebook. Works with my Samsung S8 and my Samsung tablet. I do have an old iPod touch (gen 2) and it did not support it. But these are made for apple so you will get the most of it using an iPhone. Did some research and with the iPhone, you can use Siri by holding down the button on the earbud and you can get a battery status of the powerbeats on the phone. Android, Windows, and Chromebook do not support these features. Unless there was an update recently and they fixed it. I tested all of this out months ago when I first got my powerbeats. What I love the most about these powerbeats is the security of the earbuds. To sync to new devices, the user must hold down the sync button, then connect. Once connected, the user can connect to the earbuds when they are not connected to another device. Let me give you an example. I have these connected to my laptop, phone, tablet, etc. I can take one earbud with me and put in my pocket. The charging base is at home and I am out doing errands. I can turn on my Bluetooth on my phone, find the powerbeats under Paired Devices, and it connects. I then can disconnect from my phone and connect to my tablet. Once they are connected, they remain connected. It will never switch devices. The earbuds are never in discoverable mode unless you sync them. So, someone else that has Bluetooth on and is searching for a device will not even see it, even though it is not connected to anything. With most Bluetooth devices, if it is on and disconnected, people can see the device. The last thing I will talk about is the sensor in the earbud. So far it works with all my devices. If I take out my earbud, the music or movie that is playing will stop and once I put the earbud back on, it resumes on its own. I guess one thing I do not like is that there is no battery indicator on the charging base. I will use them every day and forget to check the battery life on the charging base. Usually every 2 or 3 days I will charge the base to make sure it is always charged. Whenever the Powerbeats Pro 2 come out, hopefully they add this feature. Like 4 lights on the bottom, indicating 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The 25 should blink when almost dead. But other than that, I love my powerbeats pro!","Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2020",AFCOUVNYR4HCD3YRXCTDVFA6JI3A,True,36,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R7FPOTZIXQMHE,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional Performance,Fadi Shamaan,5,"I recently purchased the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds and I am extremely impressed with their performance. These earbuds are truly exceptional in every way and I would give them a 5 out of 5 star rating.Firstly, the sound quality of these earbuds is outstanding. The bass is deep and the highs are crisp, providing an overall clear and balanced sound. Additionally, the volume can be turned up quite loud without any distortion, which is perfect for those who like to listen to their music at high volumes. The earbuds also provide excellent noise isolation, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in your music.One of the most impressive features of these earbuds is their battery life. With up to 9 hours of listening time, these earbuds can easily last an entire day without needing to be charged. This is especially impressive considering the compact size of the earbuds. The charging case also provides an additional 24 hours of battery life, meaning you can go days without needing to charge the earbuds.The Beats Powerbeats Pro also feature the Apple H1 headphone chip, which provides a seamless connection to your Apple devices. The earbuds connect instantly and stay connected without any issues. The Class 1 Bluetooth technology also provides an excellent range, allowing you to move freely without any loss of connection.These earbuds are also sweat and water-resistant, making them perfect for workouts or outdoor activities. The earbuds have been designed to stay securely in your ears, even during the most intense workouts.Finally, the built-in microphone on these earbuds is excellent. The microphone provides clear audio and cancels out any background noise, ensuring that your voice is heard loud and clear on phone calls.Overall, I highly recommend the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds. They are an exceptional product that provides outstanding sound quality, long battery life, seamless connectivity, and are sweat and water-resistant. These earbuds are perfect for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds that can keep up with their active lifestyle.Here's a comparison between the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds and the Bose SoundSport Free Wireless EarbudsBeats Powerbeats Pro:• Price: $249.95• Connectivity: Class 1 Bluetooth• Battery Life: 9 hours (24 hours with case)• Charging Time: 5 minutes for 1.5 hours• Water Resistance: Sweat and water resistant (IPX4)• Microphone: Yes• Noise Cancellation: No• Audio Quality: Good• Design: Ear hooks for secure fit• Compatibility: Works with iOS and AndroidBose SoundSport Free:• Price: $199.00• Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0• Battery Life: 5 hours (10 hours with case)• Charging Time: 2 hours• Water Resistance: Sweat and water resistant (IPX4)• Microphone: Yes• Noise Cancellation: No• Audio Quality: Very good• Design: Ear hooks for secure fit• Compatibility: Works with iOS and AndroidBoth the Beats Powerbeats Pro and the Bose SoundSport Free are great wireless earbuds with some similar features such as sweat and water resistance, ear hooks for secure fit, and microphone. However, there are some differences in terms of connectivity, battery life, and price.The Beats Powerbeats Pro has Class 1 Bluetooth which provides a longer range and stronger connectivity compared to the Bose SoundSport Free's Bluetooth 5.0. The Powerbeats Pro also has a longer battery life with 9 hours of listening time and 24 hours with the charging case compared to the Bose SoundSport Free's 5 hours of listening time and 10 hours with the charging case. However, the Powerbeats Pro is more expensive than the Bose SoundSport Free.In terms of audio quality, both earbuds have good sound quality, but the Bose SoundSport Free is considered to have a slightly better audio quality than the Powerbeats Pro. Additionally, neither earbud has noise cancellation.Overall, both earbuds are great options depending on your needs and budget. If you want longer battery life and stronger connectivity, the Beats Powerbeats Pro may be the better choice, but if you're looking for better value for your money and slightly better audio quality, the Bose SoundSport Free could be a good option.Here's a comparison between the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds and the Sony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds in a points form:Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds:• Price: $249.95 USD• Battery Life: Up to 9 hours• Charging Case Battery Life: Up to 24 hours• Water Resistance: Sweat and water resistant• Bluetooth Version: Class 1 Bluetooth 5.0• Noise Cancellation: No• Transparency Mode: Yes• Voice Assistant: Siri (iOS) / Google Assistant (Android)• Driver Size: 9mm• Weight: 20.3gSony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds:• Price: $279.99 USD• Battery Life: Up to 8 hours (with ANC on)• Charging Case Battery Life: Up to 24 hours• Water Resistance: IPX4 water resistance• Bluetooth Version: Bluetooth 5.2• Noise Cancellation: Yes, with advanced ANC technology• Transparency Mode: Yes• Voice Assistant: Google Assistant / Alexa• Driver Size: 6mm• Weight: 7.3gAs you can see, the Beats Powerbeats Pro have a longer battery life and are sweat and water-resistant, making them ideal for workouts and outdoor activities. However, the Sony WF-1000XM4 offer advanced noise cancellation technology and are lighter in weight.The price difference is also worth noting, with the Sony WF-1000XM4 being more expensive than the Beats Powerbeats Pro. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on your personal preferences and needs.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2023",AH2UZ52SQ4HSIYYUEBYBY6R76JEA,True,126,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
RT337LQW55P9W,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Running Earphone Showdown - These were my winner,Joe,4,"EDIT: 4 months inThe sound quality of these headphones are still great and I'm still really pleased with these being my final choice. That being said, I'm dropping it from 5 stars to 4 because the connectivity issues and power issues are driving me insane. And the fact that these are premium earbuds while still having these issues is just inane. Also, I have an android, so I'm not sure if these issues exist with Apple users or not (I'm guessing at least the second issue does, if not both).First: when you put the earbuds back in the case, you have to really work at finangling them inside the case to make sure they actually register as being put away and auto disconnect from the phone. This isn't the biggest issue, it's just maybe a 30 second annoyance. But 30 second annoyance every single time you put them away gets to be more and more annoying.Second: The earbuds have been losing charge inside the case. This didn't ever happen before until I recently went on a trip and flew somewhere. The earbuds were fully charged before takeoff, and completely dead at landing. I have no idea why this happened, but I assumed it was a fluke. It happened again on the way back. Since then, the earbuds have been draining to 0% in the case without me using them. I'm not sure if this is causation or even correlation, or just pure terrible coincidence. But it is infuriating. I'm showing up to workouts and can't use them because they're dead. It's also worth noting that I did the software update around the same time as the travel, so it could be because of that software update rather than something weird about flying (which probably makes more sense).Either way, it's absolutely infuriating.Again, sound quality is still there, but the stars will continue to drop if I can't get a fix at least for this second issue.Original Review:I was looking for new earphones specifically for fitness with the main usage test being running. I wanted to test across several price points to see which would be most worth the money. I've only had cheap running earphones before (though I have nicer cans that I use to listen with in other scenarios and some nice wired in ears for when I perform live). I don't really care about noise cancelling. My primary criteria were about comfort (and if it can stay in my ear while running), and the sound quality vs price (how much marginal return do I get per dollar). I ended up picking a premium pair because you can really notice how much more digital/fake the audio sounds when testing side by side, the lower down in price you go.(note: a lot of what I put were just notes I was jotting down while testing them. I try to do a more succinct summary in the first line of each option, and then it gets more rambly/random after that)In the running:Sony WF-1000XM4 $189.00 | Beats Fit Pro - $179 | Power Beats Pro - $179 | Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89 | JBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95 | Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99 | JLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88 | Golrex $29.99 | BMani T16 $39.99Here are my thoughts:Power Beats Pro - $179 (149) - My winner overallSounds great. It is not the best sound I've heard in earphones, but doesn't seem to lack anything. Has good thumpy bass, presence in the mids, and good clarity up high. Nothing to complain about the sound.Big/heavy case (doesn't matter that much, but I do take these on big hikes so smaller case would have been nicer)I think ultimately will be more comfortable for long use than the Fit pro. The stock medium tips fit fine, unlike the fit pro for some reason.Sounds essentially the exact same as the fit pro which makes senseBeats Fit Pro - $179I wanted this to be my favorite. It's light, small, has fun color options, and sounds great. But it ultimately was just not comfortable enough to leave in my ears for longer than 45 minutes. This would vary from person to person obviously.Pretty comfortable, but had to switch to the small eartips (only earbuds I had to switch from the medium/stock tips). Stays in the ears well, but I think that the whole thing being in there will get uncomfortable pushing my ears after a while. Really little case which is nice.Really great clarity, feels perfectCan't find any eq in the app, but I didn't feel the need to adjust any eq settings either, every band/frequency was very satisfying, so that's kind of nice not having to set it myselfSony WF-1000XM4 $189.00I believe this has a slightly fuller sound quality to it. Can't really pinpoint how or why, but seems to be the most superior sound quality of all of them. I thought it might be better bass but that's not it. I can't pick a part any individual component that seem superior, it just has an overall fuller soundThere just doesn't seem to be any way that these are going to stay in during a run. Would be great for any non-exercise application, but just wasn't what I was looking for. I would choose these if I were looking for just walk around town kind of earbuds.Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89Great clarity and bass out of the box. I am the kind of guy who can only really tell sound differences when a/b testing it. If I only listened to these earbuds, I would have been fully satisfied with the sound quality, the comfort, and the security. It's only because I tested it next to the premium models above that I decided not to go with this. But if this is your budget range, these are definitely the winners.Excessively comfortable, like the most comfortable of any of the earbuds (premiums included), and feel like they will stay in on a run even though they don't have any sort of little hook like the soundcore or powerbeats, or over ear hook like the others. Definitely the best ergonomics. Would take this over the JBL endurance or any other in the sub $150 price range.Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99more satisfying for non edm music than the other options down below. Better separation for instruments and vocals.Compared against JLabs with blue tips in, the bass is more comparable. Soundcore keeps more clarity than on higher end (albeit a little tinny sounding), than JLabsBass is definitely much better than JLabs. It does feel a bit more muddy because of the heavier bass, there may have been better vocal clarity with JLabsEverything else seems fineANC is decentsmall profile is light, really comfortable and stays in the earsJLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88bigger profile, slightly less comfortable than the Soundcore. Bass is lacking out of the box. There's better mid and high clarity on these than the soundcore.Bass improves a noticeable amount by switching to blue tips, but you lose some clarity higher upbass feels punchier in edm in these than x10These are definitely more satisfying for thumpy edm music than the x10The sound quality just feels lacking in depth, no matter which eq setting you choose.Has a connected usb charger on the case as a charger (rather than a separate chord to plug into both charger and power), which I don't think I likeJBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95Clear vocals and instruments in mids and highs. Slightly more clear and crisp than the soundcoreNice bass as well, (slightly worse bass than soundcore), less satisfying than the sound core on lyrical song but actually has punchier bass on edmPlenty loud (other reviews saying they don't get loud)The equalizer app gives lots of controlThis bass is also superior once equalized. So both bass and instrumental/vocals have more clarity. After messing with eq, is better than soundcore.This sounded perfectly fine until compared with higher tier, then when a/b compared it sounded a bit more fake, a bit more digital, definitely enough to notice a differenceGolrex $29.99It is okay sound, probably the best in this price range. If you just want something cheap that will give you sound, these are fine. If you care about sound quality even a little bit, it's worth it to get a better headset.There is no clarity at any frequency, just a decent amount of noise.Has an attempted cheap premium look with led interfaces.BMani T16 $39.99Sounds way below average, worse than the golrex.Really similar packaging and look to the golrex, so they're either just copying each other or made by the same people","Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2023",AFSRAJU6KF7ZSMZHCEC3IM34FTLA,True,191,Color: NavyStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

With a good carrying case these things are INDESTRUCTIBLE! I’ve had them in the pool, at the gym. The fit is great too, so comfortable I have worn them thru 18hr work days and they haven’t let me down yet.

R18ML2DXNSHGXX,B07R5QD598,1.0 out of 5 stars I didn't know a product could be so poorly designed.,RIR,1,"This is a review for use with android and macbook proTLDR most glitchy product i've ever had in my life. Updates are few and far between and bring new glitches. Most common glitch is sound going out of sync between left and right resulting in delay, and feeling of echo in the audio: it's infuriating and requires disconnect and reconnect: sometimes with waiting in between or having to repair from box which makes the big bulky charge box a must carry everywhere: can't exactly go ona run with that thing.Imagine having to interrupt your sports routine 2-4 times to get these things working, does that make you want to work out more or less?Since i first bought them, they have been nothing but glitchy, and it took two months to have them replaced on apple care (because apple after sale service is a joke) so i made a glitch diary over the past few weeks to write this review.Android: many of these glitches are not android dependent but rather location/movement dependent, or where you put your phone dependent, or what your phone is touching dependent or next to what appliance you're standing dependent and sometimes audio app dependent (switching apps resolves the glitch).Glitches are ""seasonal"" they come and go, though some are constant. But there's always something new.-Worst and by most common glitch: the earbuds often go out of sync resulting in an echo (bc of the delay btw one ear and the other). This one is infuriating/maddening: happens everyday many times. Sometimes i just live with it because i don't want to go through the motions of disconnecting/wait/reconnect but the sync keeps drifting and it gets jarring/disorienting after a while: like chinese drip torture.- powerbeats connect, sound still comes from phone speakers-“skipping sound effect” from the connection faltering-sometimes nonstop struggle to stay in sync, stay connected-Sounds cuts in and out repeatedly with random intervals (on... off........ on.... off... on........ off...)-put them in a box and close it only to realize they’re still connected and the sound is coming out of the box still, but sometimes the opposite problem occurs: i'd be listening from macbook speakers and they. randomly connect to the laptop and start playing from within the box, and pause playback. Must turn off bluetooth on device to recover sound from speakers.-sometimes resumes all audio app after you pause and play (eg pause podcast, hit play, youtube, podcasts, audible all start playing together at the same time)- Different buttons/functions cease to work, sometimes all buttons won’t respond (sound plays buttons unresponsive), sometimes just some buttons, just volume or play, or just one earbud.-Sometimes buttons work but no sound (can see the app play/pause on the screen)-Sometimes connects (as confirmed by connection sound and bluetooth menu on phone) but no sound and buttons unresponsive. Sometimes no sound though buttons can play/pause-lag between commands and response (btw hitting play and music playing, pause and music pausing)- often disconnects from phone after a call: when you hang up sound resumes from phone speakers-sometimes disconnects during call making me run back to phone to continue call on phone- sometimes one of the earbuds ""forgets"" its charged straight out of the box, putting it back in the charge box ""reminds"" it it's actually full (goes from 0% to 100% immediately): imagine you put them on step out of the. house and realize one of the earbuds is acting dead, now you have to go back home, stick it in the huge box you don't want to carry around and. then g et back to your run/bike/routine-rarely, one earbud ""dies"" and needs to be placed in charging box for a long while before it comes back to ""life""-updates few and far between and bring new glitches- EVERYTIME I ride (bike) through specific intersections it ""slices"" the connection: audio goes out though the app continues to play and the connection is still established in the bluetooth menu.Recently (new ""seasonal"" glitches since last update ):-just doesn't automatically connect when i open box and put them on, I have to manually connect them from the bluetooth menu, sometimes i have to repair them from the box.- one ear starts playing immediately, other earbud takes 6-9 seconds to connect, during which you're standing there. waiting to see if it's this glitch or the one where one of the earbuds thinks it's empty and needs to be put back in the box to remember it's full.-earbuds connect but they don't make the connection sound so you don't know if they've connected or not without playing something- entire volume range is on the bottom three increments of the volume bar, goes from no sound (one volume click up) 50% volume (one volume click up) 100% volume and all the rest of the range no matter how much you volume up/down, remains at 100% volume.Macbook pro-refuses to connect/reconnect to macbook pro, no idea why, requires a factory reset and re pairing-randomly switches to another device mid use (from phone to macbook pro or vice versa)Sound Quality: bass ok, HIGH TREBLE many podcasts sound like there's a hissing in your ear when they pronounce the letter S. Overall sound is good but the hissing from the high trebble is annoying: one solution to this i found was to use biggest size rubber buds and shove them well into your ear: enhances bass and mitigates treble.Customer service: took nine days to ship them back to some facility to have them ""looked at"" decided they were fine within twenty minutes (i know this because they have a link to a tracker) and returned them to me (they had to overnight ship them when I blew a gasket at the store when i realized the confirmation email after nine days was just for their receipt of the product at the repair facility and not that they were done and ready for pickup: nine days, just to get from the store to the ""repair"" facility).Had to return twice more and both times same thing: they receive them, immediately decide nothing wrong with them, return them: spent the whole summer without the product i had bought SPECIFICALLY for that summer. In the end some ""genius"" i paris told me it was because they were labeling the problem as ""permanent"" as opposed to ""intermittent"" (permanent means it's always there and so it should show right out of the box)Please comment if you've been having any of these problems.thanks100% would not recommend","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020",AHODWZEEKYACPAUAQYJHC5MGJDQA,True,166,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1OI66NEAOV8TP,B07R5QD598,"5.0 out of 5 stars Well done, Beats! I would buy again... and again... and again!!!",Dillon & Cassandra,5,"I have had these for one day now and so far I love them. They are my first Beats and they have lived up to the name. They fit very snugly but also comfortably which has been hard to find. Sound quality is fantastic. I’m not an expert on sound by any means but I am very pleased with the sound from my music, podcasts and even phone calls.I have an iPhone and pairing was almost too easy to the point that I wasn’t sure if they were really paired until I started listening. It also has a nice little display when you open the case near your phone that shows battery level of the earphones as well as the case. (The case charges the earphones when they are in place).They feel very well made which was to be expected as they are Beats (Apple) after all. The case is also very nice. It’s slightly larger than expected but it could easily fit in my jacket pocket so I’m not complaining. The case has a high quality feel to it with one exception: when fully opened, the lid seems to wiggle as if it were a little loose. This was definitely not a deal breaker for me considering I didn’t buy it for the case, but rather the headphones. Just something to be aware of. When you close the case, it resumes the nice feel with a sort of snap that I’m guessing is from a magnet.As I said before, the earphones are very comfortable. I could wear them for hours and not get sore ears. I am not an athlete but I am constantly moving around the house and leaning over etc. and they will stay in until you take them out. Another benefit is that if you slightly twist them forward on your ears, it breaks the seal so that you can hear what’s going on around you, but you can still hear your music etc. it would have been nice if they had integrated the transparency technology that uses the microphones for you to hear through the actually earphones what’s going on around you but this feature works just as well. In the booklet, it mentions adjusting the “around-the-ear” hook but it seems like it just bends to different angles. My only complaint about this product which isn’t really by fault of the beats is that the hooks rub against my glasses a little. It’s not enough to make me return them and I only notice it sometimes. It’s really just a minor nuisance, but if you’re the kind of person that would be bothered by that, don’t get ones with ear hooks. It comes with 4 sets of in-ear rubber pieces. One of them on the earbuds and the other four in the packaging. So far I haven’t switched them out because they felt just fine with the ones that were already on.This brings me to packaging. I thought the packaging was excellent. Again, I expect this from a product made by Apple and I was not at all disappointed. It felt like opening a very intricate gift.Overall, I LOVE this product. I was hesitant about the price to begin with but after having them, I realize it was well worth the sale price of $170. I would even pay the previous price of $200 for them. I would absolutely recommend these! Especially if you have an iPhone (for simplified pairing and connectivity) and if you want something that stays in but doesn’t hurt (who wouldn’t want that??)!","Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2020",AE6VVWAS3GJMQ7KNIXVV7UE37TXA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Technically they don't have a noise cancellation setting that you can turn on and off but the volume button kind of activates the noise cancellation feature. I love taking phone calls with these because they never fall out of my head and I can have as sassy of a conversation as I want without flinging a bud halfway across the room .

R1MY99OSW5FWG7,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Wireless Earbuds,Garrett,4,"These are really amazing wireless earbuds. I'm gonna do pros and cons along with some other thoughts about this product. This review is written 4 months after using this product.Pros:1. Battery life. The battery life is amazing. I never had these die on me except when I play video games all night. They also have fast charging which is very useful if you need to charge them real quick.2. Fit. The fit is really perfect. They feel comfortable and they stay in my ears perfectly. I exercise a lot and these earbuds always stay in my ears when I'm at the gym and when I'm running. If you are looking for some workout earbuds, then these will give you reliable and beautiful performance.3. Sound quality. The sound quality is amazing. Nice, clear and crisp.4. The Apple features. The extra features that the Powerbeats have when using with apple devices are nice but don't let those features discourage you android users from buying the Powerbeats. The features aren't important enough for you to decide not to buy them (Not gonna list out the features in order to make this review shorter)5. Range. The range is amazing. I can be listening to music on my phone and leave my phone in my room and walk anywhere in the house and still be able to listen to the music. The music starts cutting out depending on the amount of objects blocking the signal.6. Ability to wear with glasses. I can wear these with my glasses with no problem at all. I can take my glasses on and off and have no trouble.7. Good microphone. I use these earbuds for phone calls and video calls and the person can hear me pretty good. I can hear them perfectly fine. My brother tells me that I sound muffled but he can still hear me good.Cons:1. Pain. After wearing them for a couple of hours, I start to feel slight discomfort. This only happens after many hours so it isn't something i'm complaining about. Just felt like I should mention it so everyone is aware. The pain that is the problem is the major pain that comes after weeks of regular use. I'm not sure what is happening but it's like the Powerbeats is making the skin inside my ear peel off. I think this is happening because they are too tight in my ears. This has happened I believe 3 times and the goes away after I left my ears heal. As i'm writing this review, I am experiencing the major pain and I adjusted the left earhook so it's not as tight in my ear as before (Problem is currently only in my left ear). I'm not sure if I'm the only one who experiences this but if you can deal with this then don't let that discourage you from buying the Powerbeats (It isn't that big of a problem for me).2. Bluetooth connection on Windows 10 computers. I'm not sure if this also happens on other versions of Windows and android devices but sometimes there would randomly be a 1-2 second cut in the sound about every two minutes. This doesn't happen at all on my iPhone. I would also experience random disconnections on my laptop. Another thing about the connection is that it is weaker on my laptop than on my phone. Not sure why.3. Bulky case. This doesn't matter to me at all because I usually have a bag that I carry with me when I go to places that I can slip the case into. I'm just mentioning it so people can be aware. You can put it in your pocket if you want but it will look weird because there will be a giant bulge in your pants.That's it about the pros and cons. Now it's time to talk about the problems I had with the Powerbeats. I'm having flashbacks of the problems I encountered while typing this part of the review. Problem 1. This only happened once but I will still talk about it. I was connecting the Powerbeats to my iPhone and forgetting them in the bluetooth settings because I was enjoying the animation that pops up when you pair them with your iPhone. Then all of a sudden they would not pair again. Man I thought they were already broken and it was the day I got them. I thought my $200 dollars went down the drain. But luckily I managed to get them to pair again after a long time of research and trying different things. What fixed the problem was charging the case because apparently since it was at I believe 30 something percent, it couldn't pair. Problem 2. This was the worst problem. I've had this problem happen twice in the last month and a half. One of the earbuds would not pair and sound would only come out of the earbud that was paired. I had to switch back to my other pair of wireless earbuds that I previously had until I figured out how to solve this problem. It took days of extensive research and multiple solution attempts before I finally managed to fix the problem. I was about to return them but luckily I solved the problem before I did.Final thoughts: Despite the cons and problems I encountered, I would still recommend these earbuds to anyone. If you encounter any of the problems I did, I hope you can easily solve them and if you don't, you can reply to my comment and ask me for my solution. Hopefully Amazon has a feature where you get notifications when someone replies to your review. If you read this whole thing, thank you and I appreciate it. If you didn't then thanks for taking a look at it.Update: I no longer experience the major pain in my ears and the skin peeling off after I adjusted the earhooks to get the right fit (Update written on 8/18/21).","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2020",AGQAVC4ATJJ2TILHRYBPZTPL6CRA,True,355,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1LZX7TTL4A64Z,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Finally Something That Fits My Ears,Jacquelyn,4,These fit hard to fit ears. I have several ear buds by Apple but have always had problems with them falling out of my ears when I talk or move or even yawn. My ear canals must be a strange shape because nothing has worked over the years. It just occurred to me that I need something that hooks onto my ears to secure them in place and they need to be comfortable too. I have finally found a pair of earbuds that actually stay in place and have a decent sound. The buttons are easy to push. They get the job done while I am exercising. That’s good enough for me.,"Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AFTOBSD6MFY3JYQILTILS546EBWQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R3705JNBSYTV9D,B07R5QD598,3.0 out of 5 stars Don't buy these if you want low maintenance earbuds.,Amazon Customer,3,"I was looking for a replacement for my Plantronics earbuds which loop around the ear so they don't fall off when I run etc. I really liked the Plantronics pair, but they were getting old and starting to have shorter usage time after each recharge. Unfortunately, Plantronics also seems to have stopped making them or bringing out new models since being acquired by Poly. I read some good reviews on Powerbeats Pro and it seemed like it would be a good replacement. I have had these for about 6 months now and here are my observations.Pros:1. Great sound - this gives you great overall sound. My previous earbuds were intentionally created to let outside noise in (for outside runners), so the quality of sound was never that great. With this, I do get great sound and depending on how snug you have them in your ears, they also block out some of the outside noises (but no true noise cancellation).2. Stays in place during the workout - This was a requirement for me and it works well.3. Connectivity with Apple devices - This was created as an Apple specific earbud. So it connects well with Apple devices and provides a lot of native functionality out of the box (just like AirPods) that you don't get with third party earbuds.4. Quick charging - You can get enough charge in 10-15 minutes to work out for a good 2 hours.Cons:1. No on/off button - There is no way to turn the earbuds on or off. They turn as soon as you take them out of the charging case (more on this later) and turn off when you put them back. So you have to carry the charging case with you if you want to have them with you for a longer period and do not want them fully discharged between use.2. Doesn't always turn on - I have had the issue when it doesn't turn on automatically when I take them out of the charging pod. So I will have to put them back in and out again AND double check they are turned on when I take them out again. Also, you have to make sure they are on in case you are leaving the house and not planning to take the charging case with you because that is the only way to turn them on.3. Bulky charging case- These aren't small (like AirPods or the Pixel ones) and not convenient to carry around when you are going out to work out.4. The right earbud seems to randomly turn on overnight and keeps discharging in the case - I researched this issue online and it seems to be a common problem for others who own them. Basically, you would leave them in the case to charge overnight (so they also turn off and disconnect from your phone). But if you check later, you might find that the right earbud is turned on and connected to your phone. Or most times, you take them out to go work out only to find that the right bud is at 10% or dying while the left earbud is at a 100%. So you are now stuck at home waiting for it to charge enough before you can leave.5. Buzzing noise on right earbud - This seems to happen sporadically too where you only hear a buzzing noise and no music. This also seems like a common issue from my research online. Based on advice from other users and Apple, I have disconnected and reconnected the earbuds and reset the earbuds several times to fix this issue. It has fixed the issue each time, but recurs after a few weeks.6. High maintenance - I don't know about you, but I would like something that I can use when I need to and forget about other times, except to put them up for charging. With #4 and #5 above, this has become another thing I need to worry about on top of everything else. I have NEVER had to worry about this in the past!7. Support - I tried to find support for this from Amazon and they pointed me toward Apple since these are supposedly distributed and sold by them. All I wanted was a fix to the above issues OR get a replacement for my earbuds which are still under warranty. But they want me to go into an Apple authorized store OR send these in and wait for them to fix it. Seems very convenient when it is something you use every day, right?Overall, if you are ready to put up with what I mention in the cons, this is still a great pair of earbuds that give really great sound for someone who loves music.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023",AGVDQ44DKPRDJQRZDUFFX2NV65DQ,True,34,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I really don’t line the new sensitive buttons, on the old version it was a real button to pause and play the songs and now with the no button, just a sensitive touch they get press with even my hair some times and it’s kind of frustrating.

R2TRUA64RRPG39,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars This is probably the best you can get if you have mutant-sized ears like me,Hayden Wallsinger,5,"As a quick backstory, I have a huge head. I have never had a hat that fits nor in-ear earbuds. I had been using Skullcandy earbuds because they were small enough that I could kind of just jam them into the ear canal then push on them every few minutes to keep them in. I tried Airpods, about every skullcandy variant on the market, offbrand, and more. I am happy to say that the search is over!Everyone knows about the quality of the sound that Beats have. They are well known for it and since I used to own a pair of over-ear headphones by Beats I can comfortably say the sound hasn't really changed. The build quality is impressive and no material in the box feels tacky or cheap. Although the new iPhones are using USB-C for their cable which will make this obsolete for new phones, I do appreciate that I can use the same lightning cable for my iPhone 13 that I use to charge the docking holder thingy. One less cable I need to carry around.The fit is really good. Astoundingly good. I have always preferred over-ear loops to hold buds in because I can feel a bit more secure in wearing them and it helps to keep the buds centered. In addition to having large ears and a large head, I was also given large ear canals which constantly would spit out my previous skullcandy buds over time and make me paranoid that they were going to disappear. These still leave a bit to be desired for fit as they are just slightly too small for my ears. This all being said, I am a mutant with big ears and 99.99% of the population are going to find these fit like a glove.Finally, the smaller features of the buds really helps push them over the edge. Built-in detectors on the buds detect if you are taking them off and automatically pause the music/video you are watching. This is especially crucial for a person like me who regularly has to put them on then take them off when I get accosted by coworkers on a minute-by-minute basis. The volume controls are in a good spot and I appreciate that they are an actual button instead of some of the finicky touch controls that other companies use. Finally, I find the carrying case to be extremely bulky, but with the battery life I have experienced with these buds I am not at all going to complain about it. Manufacturer spec states 9 hours in ear with the charge in the case providing a total of 24 hours. They have to be going with the modest route! They have to be! I got 38 out of them on a work trip between Seattle and Dubai. I charged the case and the buds to the max before my flight than forgot to charge them while I was away. They died about 2 hours outside SeaTac on the return flight.Overall these are quality buds with good sound quality, great build, and a range of small stuff that eliminates the hassle normally encountered with bluetooth buds. If you get asked often, ""is your hearing good with ears the size of an elephant?"" than these buds are the one for you! If you are not shamed due to your large ears, they probably will work just as well for you too.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AF77BBBGGM7O3YF7WVQFILDXKNPQ,True,27,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R2KIEGX9V68B1T,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Get these while you can.,Mikecash_,5,"I purchased the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds November of 2022, it's July of 2023 right now and I am extremely happy with this purchase. It is rumored that there will be a new model coming out soon, which may be why the price of this model is currently on sale. I would get them at the price they are while you can!There are a few possible issues with these earbuds and if I could give them 4.5 or 4.75 I would, but the pros certainly outweigh the cons - perceived or real.Pros 1st:1. Sound quality. These are so much better than the bargain earbuds that I have always used that it's not even comparable. There is a very clear and crisp sound. On an airplane or in a crowded room, you can turn the volume up as high as you want and there's no distortion in the sound.2. Noise Cancelation. While not comparable to over the ear headphones for in-ear buds I can't imagine that you would get much better.3. Wrap Around feature. When I was deciding between the Powerbeats Pro and the Apple AirPods pro. It was the wrap around feature that was the tie-breaker. I have used these earbuds in a plane, in the gym, on a hiking trail, and various other places and I have never had them fall out of my ear - which is the point. I have helped others look for their in-ear buds on planes and in the gym and I didn't want that to be me.3. Battery life and charging time. I use these earbuds almost every single day. The battery has never been an issue. Some might consider that fact that the beats use the lighting cable instead of USB-C, but for me that has been a plus. I can charge the beats case in my truck with my iPhone charger if it ever gets to it. The old problem of the buds not sitting in the case correctly and thus burning through the charge on the case after you take off the charger has been resolved. Or at least it has never one time been a problem for me.4. Additional pros. The seamless connection to your Apple devices and the range after connection are worthy mentions. The built-in microphone provides clear audio that cancels out much of the background noise. And the sweat and water-resistant quality makes them perfect for workouts or outdoor activities.Cons:1. The ""Find My"" feature on iPhone is not very helpful for the Powerbeats. If they are paired you can find them if they are laying around the house somewhere, but I don't think it would be helpful at all if you leave them behind somewhere. And you cannot see them separately, you see both the left and right side together. This is certainly one area where AirPods would have the advantage.2. The size of the case. Compared to most earbuds this case is HUGE. Most people will not want to stick them in their pocket as you can with most others. I carry them in my backpack most of the time because of the size.3. The size of the ear tips. I have tried every set that comes with the beats and I'm down to the smallest size. They fit me perfectly but I do not have the smallest ear canals.One other thing to note: These work just fine with my glasses but the arms on my glasses are straight. If you have over the ear arms, it might be more of a problem.These earbuds are perfect for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds that can keep up with their active lifestyle.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2023",AFSNSQNQVEZTUVNT7BE4LEKOE6VQ,True,207,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

RZKYQ47MFPJKI,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars These Buds Don't Fall Out For No One!,Raenell,4,"I purchased these after I got Apple Airpods Pro because those fell out of my ears after I leaned over to get something that fell in my car. I was very bummed about the Airpods and tried the various ear fittings, but found that it didn't matter and bought them for running and working out at the gym. Upon ordering and receiving the Powerbeats Pro, I knew that they would be a great fit and was very impressed with the fit, the various sizes of buds (5 options) to find a great fit, and the battery life is amazing! Though they are not noise-canceling, I know that these will not fall out or off of my ears and will be great for running or jumping around at the gym. The downside to these, in my opinion, is that the level of sound has to be turned up quite high and makes me worried that I'm damaging my ears. I've checked this a few times to see if it's my phone or Spotify (iPhone 12), but it's not and I'm not sure if it's a manufacturing thing. The battery lasts a very long time and I've driven for hours talking and never have the person on the other end complain of noise like my old headphones. I love it too because when someone calls, it automatically goes to my earbuds if they are in and they connect quickly. I would recommend these because they are Bluetooth, convenient, and don't hurt to have them in. In the past, I've tried over-the-ear headphones, cordless or Bluetooth, and struggled with the fit and find that these are great.

They take a bit of time to get the hang of putting them on but with ear hooks, they stay put even during workouts. The Powerbuds are clear when used for phone calls. The case is bulkier than either Samsung earbuds or AirPod Pros but the design with built ear hooks makes them more utilitarian when on the go.

As an avid music lover, I can confidently say that these earbuds deliver rich, immersive sound that truly enhances every beat and melody.One of the standout features of these earbuds is the Apple H1 Headphone Chip, which ensures seamless connectivity and efficient power management. The Class 1 Bluetooth technology provides reliable wireless performance, allowing me to enjoy my favorite music with minimal interruptions.Additionally, the sweat-resistant design makes these earbuds perfect for workouts and outdoor activities. Whether I'm hitting the gym or going for a run, I can count on these earbuds to stay in place and deliver uninterrupted sound quality.However, the only issue I've encountered is with the stability of the earbuds during intense movement. While they fit snugly in my ears during most activities, I've noticed that they may become slightly dislodged if I'm moving around vigorously. This is a minor inconvenience for me, but it's worth noting for those who engage in high-impact activities regularly.Overall, the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone seeking top-notch sound quality and wireless convenience. Despite the minor stability concern, these earbuds offer an unparalleled listening experience that is sure to impress even the most discerning audiophiles.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2024",AH3BBCN5NOAGVN4OOZNO73665HNQ,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

RLRFWMQOWEANN,B07R5QD598,"4.0 out of 5 stars A short review, if you're trying to decide on buying this...",Kevin S. Goff,4,"I've been a music junkie for decades and have had many headphones/earbuds.I'd give these a ""4 1/2 stars out of five""On the good side:1) I use Tidal with Boom on my iPhone and I have over 200 GB of music on my phone. I had to tweak the sound settings on the Boom equalizer to get sound setting I want. Out of the box, I'd say the sound quality is good but not necessarily exceptional. But if you have an equalizer, odds are higher you'll be satisfied.2) I've found that the battery life is indeed about 9 hours and the charging time is about what they advertise.3) As for the fit: these are not going to fall out or slip (unless someone walks up to you and physically tries to pull them out). The fit is perfect. (See my notes further down for the ""comfort"")4) I've rarely had problems pairing. I've used these nearly every day for a year and a half and have rarely had pairing issues with the iPhone. I can't speak for Android, as I don't use it.OK, the ""not so good"" side:1) The charging case does not support wireless charging.2) The charging case is a tad large (in fairness, these buds are larger, hence the better battery life). You ""can"" put it in your pockets (pants) but you'll notice it.3) OK, on the comfort: the human ear isn't designed to have something stuck into it for hours at a time without feeling the pressure. Yes, there are some buds that fit in a way that you won't feel the pressure, though I have to wonder what the downside is, as far as secure fit and seal.Having said that, if I have these in my ears for more than 90 minutes, I sometimes need to take them out for a few minutes, just to let my ears ""breathe"".Overall, give this 4.5 stars out of 5. The three things I mentioned are not ""deal breakers"" for me, but they might be if you are looking for something that will feel comfortable for hours. As much as I love these (and I do love them), I do need to pull them out for a few minutes.Also, there is no ANC. Yes, there's ""noise reduction"" but not cancellation. I'm mainly in the suburbs and really don't have the need for ANC. However, it's always a personal choice, and if you spend a great deal of time in a noisy city/transportation system, you might want to look at the newest Bose.So - these are not perfect. but they are very good and I'm happy with them. I love the battery life, the secure fit, and overall sound quality (after some tweaking). I listen to tons of jazz and classical and 70's rock and am happy with these.I had a few wireless buds before these, and was always wondering if ""the grass is greener"" with another set. I have to be honest, after buying these, my interest in finding better ones down the road is much lower.Most reviews I've read are positive on this product. Yes, a few negative ones, but mostly positive. I bought these when they were a bit pricier, and even though they've dropped the price a bit, I'm not angry - I really like them a lot.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2022",AGPCSSLIATSAHUEUEFPDOK2WLTWQ,True,55,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R247P4C3C5EEXY,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Wireless Earbuds - For About 2 Years,Arnold,4,"I don't know if Amazon will list how many times I've purchased these, but this will be my 3rd pair ( 5 if you include the ones that I had to return, 1 was missing the Powerbeats itself and the other had a manufacturing defect ) that I have purchased.The sound of the Powerbeats is great for wireless earbuds and the battery life of both charging case and earbuds are great out of the box! The ear hooks help keep the earbuds in and I don't have to worry about losing one earbud due to it falling out, unlike the Apple Airpods that I keep finding on the ground at work... Having purchased this product a discounted price, I am very satisfied.The only problem I have with this product is the longevity of the batteries of the earbuds and charging case as time passes. After about the 2 year mark, the earbud that is used the most will last about 1-1.5 hours listening to audio and 15 minutes while on a voice call. The lithium ion batteries degrade too rapidly for a product at this price range.Overall, this is a great product, but I wish there was an battery alternative, because even just replacing the batteries at a local electronic repair store is about the same price as brand new Powerbeats at a discount ( approx $150 total to replace the earbud batteries ).","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2024",AEXTQVIKQK72BB6WPCVVUX73H3KQ,True,0,Color: NavyStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2QLUHTUKVZ0S4,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars After 3 years…,Digimartyr,4,"I bought these back in 2020, and have been using them ever since. It’s been about a year, but the microphone has degraded and is highly inefficient. It’s amazingly convenient that if you’re listening to music, or just have these in your ear, it’ll pause when you receive a call. You’re then able to press the button to answer. Thing is, the person I’m speaking to would say that I sound muffled and very far away. I’d say in the initial two years that I’ve had these they’ve worked flawlessly. Now I’d have to disconnect from Bluetooth and answer a call as you normally would. It’s very annoying to do when you expect that to be a function of these.Also, when charging the headphones in the case, the nodes on the headphones (or on the case) have degraded to the point where I’d have to keep them pushed down for the connection to be made. It’s a bit frustrating when I forget to do so only to find that one ear has lost power when I thought it was charging the entire time.Otherwise, because they wrap around your ear I’ve NEVER feared them falling out. It hasn’t even been close to coming out when going for a run or going to the gym. They can be cumbersome if you have long hair that covers your ears, but you’ll get use to pushing your hair back to fit them in. I’ve had long hair, and dreads, so trust that that becomes less of an issue as time goes on.Otherwise these perform quite well as headphones on the go. For the bells and whistles of noise cancellation, “aware mode” (being able to hear what’s around you), and top notch sound quality, I leave that to around the ear headphones. It’s of little significance to me with these little things.**EDIT**So, while both headphones are in, the left ears power gets depleted much faster than the left. When checking the power it still reads at least 50%, the right ear being 80%. It’ll then require another charge before working again. So……there’s that too…","Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2023",AF4TDDEJFZEQ4TPUNVXBQRRLKM3Q,True,4,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R3HL180XQU0CCI,B07R5QD598,3.0 out of 5 stars Powerbeats Pro have a tinny sound and hurt my ears,MikeW,3,"For the price I paid I expected superior sound but the Powerbeats Pro sound tinny with no Bass. After wearing them to the gym for a couple of hours my ears were sore. Sound was superior and fit more comfortable with my old and less expensive Plantronics earbuds which, unfortunately, are no longer made. They did connect and set up on my iPhone very easily but for the price I expected more. I have debated sending them back but I bought the Apple Care with them and don’t want the hassle involved in returning them. I only wear them cycling, running and at the gym so I will probably just live with them. Tried changing the ear tips but it didn’t help with the Bass or comfort. I wouldn’t recommend these.Update to my review of Feb 1, 2023. The left ear bud frequently failed to charge and both earbuds had problems connecting forcing me to go to settings Bluetooth and forget the device and reinstall. Now the earbuds in the case will not connect to my iPhone. I did get AppleCare+ with the earbuds and called tech support but nothing we did would get the earbuds to connect. They are sending a replacement and hopefully it will perform better than the original earbuds. I would not consider purchasing these without the AppleCare extended warranty.Next update: Received my new Powerbeats earbuds and case. At first they charged great, no problem. Now after a month one of earbuds will fail to charge. I have to repeatedly check them to make sure both earbuds are charging. They use magnets to pull the earbuds into place but you still need to push them down to insure the buds are connecting properly to charge. When you close the case often one of the earbuds will lose connection and not charge but will in fact discharge. I constantly get ready to go for a run or to the gym and discover that one esrbud is 100% charged and the other one has no charge or is at 2% or so and will not operate. I then have to try and readjust the discharged earbud in the case and wait for it to charge before going. Annoying to say the least. Also if you sweat while working out, running, etc the contacts will quickly corrode and you have to clean them regularly for them to recharge. Definitely wish I had not purchased these but for the price I paid I can’t afford to just throw them away and buy a different brand. For the next 2 years I guess I will just keep using my AppleCare to return them when they stop working properly.UPDATE: May 15, 2023. Well the left earbud started failing to charge. Cleaned contacts with alcohol using a cotton Q-Tip. Didn’t help. Finally manually reset the charging case and the left earbud started charging though it stalled several times at 50% charged. Finally got the left earbud to charge but have the feeling that these will soon be going back to AppleCare for replacement.UPDATE: July 4, 2023. Left earbud still failing to charge unless I play with it in the case until the red charging light comes on. Then for seemingly no reason it will stop charging and start discharging so that when I go to bed it is charged at 90% but when I get up in the morning to go for my run the right earbud is still fully charged but the left one is now down to 10%. Found out that there is a class action suit being prepared against the Beats Powerbeats pro in several states because of these charging issues Unfortunately Florida is not one of the states in the lawsuit. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE EARBUDS. In the end you will be unhappy if you do.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2023",AE57GQUQQAOW6EK6JFTU6UCBW2HA,True,13,Color: NavyStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R1XRA40FXWHENG,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars good but lots of cons,sayock,4,"These are the best earphones I’ve ever tried, including more expensive Bose earphones. But there are definitely many cons.-I agree with those who say the midrange is lacking in quality.-As with most earphones, the sound quality decreases dramatically depending on what size ear cups you use on the earphones. The powerbeats pro totally wireless come with about 4 different sizes, but, personally, only one makes these earphones any good in terms of sound quality, i.e. the largest size.-I find these hard to put on. Part of the reason why this is the case is because the buttons that control it are pretty much all the places you want to put your fingers in trying to put these on your ears. It’s very hard to try and put these on without accidentally pressing a button and music starting to play prematurely.-I had read before receiving these that they do get uncomfortable after a while, and they really do—especially in one ear (for me, it’s the right ear). My ears will also start itching after a while, and I have to take these out to scratch and then struggle to put them back on (see my previous point).-You better stick with and use your case with these, because these could be really easy to lose and the ear cups can easily come off if you are very mobile. I have to fight the urge to just place these on my bed sometimes, knowing they can easily go bye bye that way. I don’t love the idea of always needing to carry a case around with these or always leaving them in my ears just to make sure I can keep up with them. This is where wired earphones that don’t have changeable cups are better.-Because they operate via bluetooth, often when you go to the next song the first second or two of the song is cut off. I have the same issue with some other bluetooth speakers, and it’s something that caused me to stop using them. Very annoying.Those are my biggest cons with them, although there are others that are probably more specific annoyances to me.Pros:-If you have an iPhone or iPad, it will show on the screen how much charge your case and your earphones have. Love this feature.-The charge is pretty long-lasting for both the case and the earphones. Have not had to charge the case since getting these a few days ago, and that charge is still well over 50%.-Best bass in a pair of earphones, if you have the right size ear cups on.-Easier to pair with your devices (and easier to use) than most of the cheap wireless earbuds I’ve seen, but especially if you have an iPhone or iPad.-Overall, the sound quality is good, especially for earphones—it’s just the mids that are not perfect, but it seems like no earphones are perfect unless you’re the type who hates bass...in that case, you can find many “perfect” earphones.-They do stay in place, unlike other earphones. Very big deal!-The controls do a lot and are fairly easy to learn and to use, although not totally perfect.I do want to caution that I order from Amazon a ton, and when I ordered these for a Christmas present for myself (someone else paid, so it was really a gift from them), Amazon’s delivery truck “lost” them after showing my house was the next stop for them to deliver these. I have never had a lost package from Amazon, especially when UPS or USPS delivers. I had to order from Walmart before getting my Amazon refund to get this by Christmas. I just think it’s odd that the first time I order an expensive, popular electronic device and it’s Christmas time, Amazon’s drivers suddenly lose my order on the way to my house.

R3AQHZ5W95PLS9,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars One of my best purchases,Michelle Benoit,5,"I had a bad experience with the original Powerbeats, but found myself drawn to the Powerbeats Pro. I contemplated getting either those or AirPods. Despite many people saying it wasn’t a problem, I didn’t like that the AirPods simply went into my ear without any way to secure them. I lift weights, and the last thing I wanted was for one of them to pop out at an inopportune time. I also didn’t like the fact that there was no volume control on the AirPods. The Powerbeats Pro allow me to adjust the volume from BOTH earpieces. That way if my right hand is occupied, I can adjust the volume with my left hand, or vice versa. Here are my pros and cons.Pros: #1 These headphones last a pretty long time on a full charge. They don’t last as long if you’re using them for a phone call, but if you’re simply listening to music, you will get 5+ hours out of them. #2 Again, I love that I can adjust the volume, start, stop, repeat or skip a song directly on my earpiece, rather than having to reach for my phone, which is often buried at the bottom of my bag. #3 I’m sure the AirPods do this as well, but I love how the Powerbeats Pro integrate with Siri once you allow the right settings. I don’t even need to touch my phone or my earpiece, I can simply say “Hey Siri” and ask the time, the weather, what a word means, have someone on my contact list called or messaged, etc.Cons: #1 I wish the earpieces were truly adjustable. They don't come with different sizes of inner-ear pads, and the over-the-ear hooks don’t adjust as much as I would like. At times they can feel uncomfortable and somewhat painful. #2 I learned the hard way that despite it being an added burden, it might be a good idea to take the charging case with you when you leave the house. I’ve been out while all of a sudden, one of my headphones stops working despite having a substantial charge. The only way to reconnect both pieces is to place them back in the carrying case and re-pair. #3 Sometimes if you don’t sit the headphones onto the charging prongs correctly, one (or both) might not properly charge. That can be very frustrating when you’re ready to use them. When you go to Bluetooth settings on your phone and first connect them, sometimes a box will pop up letting you know how much power is left in the case, as well as the charges on the earpieces. If you pull only one of the earpieces out, it will tell you the charge of each piece individually. Unfortunately I don’t always receive that dialog box, which is very helpful.Overall, I absolutely LOVE my Powerbeats Pro, and they are certainly one of my favorite and most satisfactory purchases. In fact, I love them so much that I own two pairs of headphones and alternate between both. I like throwing one into my gym bag as a backup, just in case I need it.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2021",AEDCHMFS55CNEVNVFN7JVEQVYZSA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R37DEWR5YZ3SZP,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Can't believe it's been four years,Maggie The Red,5,"Y'all can tell me if this is a good buy, but I've had these Beats earbuds now going on to 4 years. At first I thought, what is wrong with these I just got these and the battery seems to only last 2 hours, well I looked back at my history and realized I've actually had these for 4 years and I use them A LOT! I love to have them in while I'm working and listen to YouTube or TV or just talk to a friend so I can still work with my hands. I walk the dog and talk with my mom, or whatever it is, I'm multi-tasking but recently realized these Beats are dying on me. So I thought it was good that these have lasted me almost 4 years. Is that good? Electronics don't seem to last as long as they used to. These are comfortable and have definitely stood up to a lot of use. Friends have told me that Apple iPods don't last this long, so I think I'm going to get myself another pair of these Beats. I paid about $150 for these on a Black Friday special, so that's $42/yr if you figure 3.5 years use.

R2Q1CA4D9VFS5C,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Good,Tim,4,"I've had these almost 2 years now. They're good headphones and are worth the price when on sale if you're an Apple user.Comfort is important since I bought them for working out and walks and I have no major complaints there. These are pretty lightweight despite the large package and stay in the ear well. I don't have any issues wearing these for a few hours. I also appreciate the hardware buttons: one large button for play/pause and skip, and dedicated volume up/down buttons on each ear! The misguided crusade against buttons has condemned many wireless headphones to unreliable and hard to use touch interfaces and the Powerbeats Pro are fortunately not part of this trend.They're not the best sounding headphones ever, I've used (wired) IEMs that cost less than half what these do and sound better. But you don't buy wireless headphones for audiophile purposes. Audio quality is fine and doesn't actively annoy me, so they pass. There is no built in noise canceling so if you want that you're probably better off with some newer headphones.Battery life is good enough for my purposes. I don't think I've ever actually tested the claimed 9 hours since I prefer full sized headphones for real extended listening, but haven't had issues using for over 5 hours on a single charge. Now, one my biggest issue with these is with the design of the case: even after this long time using the Powerbeats it can be hard to get them to sit in the case properly so that both earbuds charge. It can be a nasty surprise to put your headphones in to charge overnight and discover the next day that one ear is dead instead of charged. You need to check the battery widget on your phone to make sure it indicates both ears are charging, and then be gentle so that the snap of the case closing doesn't knock one of the earbuds loose. As you might have guessed, carrying the case around while charging can be problematic. There are magnets that are supposed to hold the headphones in place but they don't seem to be strong enough to do the job.Now the main reason these are better than other, maybe cheaper wireless headphones is the superior integration with Apple. As someone who hops between iPhone and Android, I can say there's unfortunately no better bluetooth connectivity available than there is between iPhones and headphones with the H1 chip. When I use non-Apple headphones I never feel fully confident taking them out of the case to take an incoming call, because there's a decent chance they either won't connect without fiddling with the Bluetooth menu or the glitchiness of the connection process will drop the call (particularly on Android) or drop me into the call sounding like a robot. With the Powerbeats Pro I don't feel that nervousness grabbing them to take a call. Bluetooth still isn't as reliable as plugging into a headphone jack (remember those?) but iPhone with H1 based headphones is as close as you can get.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2021",AHU6Z4ZEM2QWYMI2YXBXXB7YPZJA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I could wear them on hour long runs without them slipping out, only with mild discomfort after about an hour of wear.

R839TV3ECR12X,B096SV8SJG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, great sound, and perfect amount of active noise cancellation",Phenix,5,"I ordered these on sale after my favorite earbuds’ case stopped reliably charging and found they had been discontinued. I have a hard time finding earbuds that stay in and don’t hurt my ears. I have a set of Bose over ear anc headphones, but I like having earbuds because I can stick them in my purse or pocket and always have them handy. I was really skeptical of these because I figured they were more branding and hype than performance- but I was pleasantly surprised. These have a lot more clarity of sound than I had expected in the high and mid ranges. I was afraid they would be very bass heavy at the expense of higher ranges, and was pleased that this wasn’t the case.Pros- 1. comfortable fit. I can wear these all day without my ears hurting. 2. Good sound quality. They are not Bose quality sound, but they also aren’t Bose prices. 3. Smooth Apple connectivity - this is the most noticeable difference compared to my other favorite earbuds. These connect easily and smoothly and work with Siri in ways my other earbuds wouldn’t. 4. Noise cancellation- great noise cancellation without completely drowning everything out. I sometimes use these in louder environments because the active noise cancellation works great to dampen loud environmental noises. I highly recommend these if you are someone who, like me, gets sensory overload when there is too much noise. These don’t have a noticeable humming/buzzing noise like I notice with Bose’ anc.Cons- 1. overly touchy controls on the earbuds. I have accidentally hung up on people several times when trying to adjust an earbud. 2. Definitely worth every penny of the sale price - I’m not sure I would pay the full ticket price for these but if you can catch them on sale, grab them. There are earbuds of comparable sound quality for substantially less cost, but these are definitely higher end sound. I would not consider them audiophile quality if that is what you are looking for, but they deliver a good, solid, quality sound. 3. Charging case- the charging case closes firmly, opens easily, and the slim rounded design means they fit in your pocket without being bulky.Overall, I love these and I have purchased so many earbuds that I end up never using because they either hurt my ears, fall out too easily, or have terrible sound quality. I can listen to music, videos, movies, and audiobooks and the sound quality works and transitions well for all of these different media types.","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2024",AFNWZZIIVDVU5ZXMXWEKWPRQ7H6A,True,77,Color: Sunset PinkStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it’s like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it’s not straight up refusing to connect it’s disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that’s a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn’t pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,True,25,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

It was easy to set up and pair and the sound is excellent. ""Transparency mode"", which allows some ambient sound, works very well without a huge impact on battery life. The only negative I can come up with so far is that the super high gloss finish on the buds can be challenging to grip, especially when removing them from the case. A light texture added just to the grip area would solve this without noticeably disrupting the cosmetics; something for the designers to consider.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AGCJX4UIM2UJ4ZEAVA6EFZMQOJNA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R3QIOBHH01818S,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not excellent for Beats,Amy L.,4,"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible. Ok for everyday headphones that aren't too pricey.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AE4SCIH4EIJQNY4BA7TKFA7WD6IQ,True,0,Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R31F3JV1FZHHWR,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Prefect,Casey Alcorn,5,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds, and I am thoroughly impressed with their performance and features. These true wireless earbuds offer a fantastic combination of quality sound, active noise cancellation, and versatility across both Apple and Android devices.Firstly, the sound quality is outstanding. The Studio Buds deliver rich, balanced audio with deep bass and clear highs, making them perfect for music, podcasts, and calls. The active noise cancellation feature effectively reduces ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience wherever you are.The earbuds are lightweight and comfortable, designed for extended wear. They come with multiple ear tip options to ensure a secure fit, enhancing noise isolation and comfort even during vigorous activities.I appreciate the IPX4 rating, which makes the earbuds sweat and water-resistant. This feature is ideal for workouts or outdoor use, providing peace of mind against moisture damage.The built-in microphone offers clear voice quality during calls, ensuring excellent communication without background noise interference.Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, thanks to the Class 1 technology, providing a stable connection and extended range for reliable performance.Overall, the Beats Studio Buds are a top-notch choice for anyone seeking high-quality true wireless earbuds with noise cancellation, sweat resistance, and broad compatibility. They combine superior sound with comfort and durability, making them a valuable investment for both music enthusiasts and professionals alike.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AHM7ESHVZOTYFVQJFKL6LYJSCKKA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
RZSTHLOHCJIJV,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.,bigyuki555,4,"Audio quality if quite good and ANC works well but transparency leaves a lot to be desired.I switched from AirPod Pro1 after nearly 5 years of daily use believing that the Beats are new and normally only about $75 less than the AirPod Pro so the quality should be pretty similar between 5-year-old AirPods and brand-new Beats, and according to the text descriptions they are...but there is a remarkable difference in performance on the transparency mode.To the point where just having the earbuds in your ears and nothing playing is not any better than just having old style earbuds/earplugs in your ears. Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb. If you are most interested in audio quality and noise cancellation, then the Beats will tick your boxes.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHPF7TUW7QLABIRVWV55ORHEXFXA,True,0,Color: Moon GrayStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

The earpiece hit the oven door, slid down a gap in the bottom and landed near the gas flame. I turned the oven off quickly and dissembled hot oven parts, but as you can in imagine, it took me a little bit. The earpiece came out super hot. I let it cool a bit and tried it and the audio was off, a lot of static.Let them completely cool for a day and they work perfectly. I can’t even tell that I accidentally baked in of them. No difference between the two in terms of operating (charging, connecting, ect)The one downside of the beats is that they seem to have a harder time connecting to my devices, it takes a bit longer than cheaper ear buds.. but the trade off in quality is worth it.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AF4WJZO7PR23JVCZITVRRIH4P34A,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

When I first got them they would last all day without needing a charge but now I can barely get to lunch before needing to charge. That’s the only disappointing part is that battery life doesn’t last long over time of ownership. Great for listening to music all day long. I can’t hear when people come up to my desk.

I have some really cheap ear buds that as soon as I pick up the ear bud, it connects to my phone. These take longer and sometimes simply don’t connect at all. Then I have to put them back in their case and try again. I’m not sure if it is because my iPhone is an older model, but that shouldn’t matter as far as I know. For an Apple product, their quality falls short. I wouldn’t recommend these. I have had better experiences with Taotronics brand.

Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on 😆.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,True,16,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,True,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,True,40,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R12JTQNZSU744L,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Execellent for Audiobooks,Jillalex,4,"I am glad I bought these, especially when they were on sale for ~$75. I was struggling with wired earbuds and a new iPhone 15, which meant having to use an adapter, and I was frustrated by the ones I tried. I thought I would lose mobile earbuds but it's been a month, so far so good.For my primary use, listening to audiobooks, these work great. The sound quality is fine. I've listened to music—also fine.It comes with a few alternate earbud sizes, but none has been a perfect fit. One side or the other falls out when I lean over, so I have to make sure they're in good. When one falls out, I don't know why, but it's almost impossible to find, even though they're red. I've used FindMy a few times. I have to move the base and the other earbud into another room as far away as possible, and under a pillow, or I can't differentiate the FindMy beeps. But FindMy works great!Last week, while washing dishes, my left earbud popped out—into a bowl of water! I scooped it out immediately, dried it off, and planned to put it in a baggy with silica packets. I was sure I'd killed it. But I am not very patient. I popped it back in after a minute. It worked great!!They have an okay run time but I am often surprised when I hear the signal that means the battery is almost out. On the plus side, when I pop them back in the case for even 15 minutes, they charge fast. At night, I charge the case and within maybe 15–30 minutes, it's all charged up, so I can then charge my phone.I'm not sure that the background cancelling works well or that there's much if any difference, according to people I've been on the phone with. Since I know that, I wait to do the dishes when I'm off the phone. Kind of a drag.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2024",AH3UG5KR6JLVKMYMZSEU2DPIDMTQ,True,6,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R3DP5AYVDBKQJZ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Won’t Stay Stay Paired - Sound Cuts Out,Beth,3,"As far as sound quality goes, I would give these earbuds a four. Battery life was also good. Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesn’t do any good when their charging box is hours away and you’re out exercising. The last time that happened to me, I took the earbuds out and threw them in the woods as far as I could throw them. I have a couple sets of wireless earbuds that don’t sound as well, but I would much rather have them as they are reliable. Very disappointed for earbuds and that price range.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AE5C4XAN3IXZUKY43ORDV36FPHHQ,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R2VWVE6E3OMTBW,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars 6 month review,ashlee,3,"I wanted to wait a few months to give an honest review. I wear my earbuds quit frequently and here for the issues I've encountered with the Beat's studio buds. They did not come with an earpiece that was small enough to fit in my ears. I know that is probably a me issue and not necessarily the earbuds faults but do keep in mind if you have smaller ears, you may have trouble with these. Also, more than likely due to that, they did not stay in my ear very well. They constantly fell out of my ears all the time. I mostly use them for music or watching shows, but I do not think they would hold up very well if I was to go running. Also, the left ear bud was always cutting in and out with the sound. I'm not sure if I just got a faulty earbud or what but after a few weeks it stopped working more than it did. These are also not earbuds I would wear for an extended period of time either. They would start to hurt my ears after a while and were not very comfortable at all. The battery life was not great either. I feel like I was constantly having to charge them.All in all they were just okay headphones. I originally had airpod pro's and then they got water damamge. I got these when they went on sale instead of spending more money on a new pair of airpod pro's, however; after 6 months of discomfort and inconsistency with the sound, i did end up just repurchasing a new pair of airpod pro's. This was just my experience with the earbuds so like anything else take that with a grain of salt.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AHQX6W5IM3N2KY6H6KCOQJTORMFA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

Sometimes one click pauses the music and then you click again and it doesn't start up..sometimes it does start up..maddening for a guy like me.Also, I don't agree with the user interface where you push down on the button to raise lower volume..I prefer each tap changes volume incrementally so you can fine tune the exact volume you want. Presently when holding down the button the volume zips higher or lower..no control really.Additionally, what's the logic behind having the same command to lower/raise the volume as pausing the music? I can't tell you how many times I just wanted to lower/raise the volume slightly, which meant a quick hold down of the button, but the buds interpreted that as tapping the button once which pauses the music..maddening!Sent em back..what a shame","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AHXIXM4LNN4K6LIAV4ONUHRY6GXQ,True,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

In this case the Airpords are better. So putting your head on the pillow with the Beats bud sees your music pause more often than not when turning your head. Other than that the Beats are great and sound just as good or even better than the Airpods.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2024",AHEYUAIV2A5KPSDNOIUT7OHAE3IQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

They were the illest, promising to transport me to a musical nirvana with every beat drop. As I’m strutting, grooving to the tunes, I notice a group of pigeons doing some sort of impromptu dance-off. Mesmerized, I decide to join in, feeling like the coolest bird on the block.But here’s where things take a hilarious turn. In the midst of my pigeon-inspired dance moves, my Beats by Dre headphones suddenly decide to go rogue. Maybe they were feeling the rhythm too much, who knows? Next thing I know, they’re catapulting off my head and soaring through the air like they’ve got wings of their own. I watch in horror as they land smack dab in the middle of a fountain, where a bunch of kids are having a water fight.Now, not only are my beloved headphones soaked to the core, but they’re also getting pelted with water balloons and drenched in soda. Talk about a tragic comedy! I wade through the chaos, dodging water projectiles like a ninja, and finally rescue my Beats from their aquatic escapade.

R1HA6GWOISYTFN,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Purchased these in Nov 2019 & still going strong,Melanie Hawthorne,4,"I bought my 2nd gen Airpods back in 2019 and never expected for them to last this long. (In fact, I was a skeptic when Apple first announced how these things would stay in your ears.) Sounds quality hasn't diminished over time. It picks up ambient sound pretty well, sometimes making it hard for the caller to hear you. Sometimes it has a muted sound and the caller will say you sound muffled. So it's not perfect as a mic device but functions well enough most of the time that it's not a problem. Audio quality to me is great. Never have an issue with sound, music, or hearing a caller. They're not really noise-canceling, so if you're looking for that, you'll be disappointed. However, I've found that if I up the volume, it will drown out loud sounds. I don't like my volume extremely loud since I like to be able to hear what's going on around me, but for trains or large trucks rumbling by, the volume is excellent and still retains good quality. (Not that distortion sound that comes with playing music too loud.)Overall, I'd recommend. I've had this for nearly 5 years (bought it for myself as a Black Friday gift!), and I don't regret it. I see no need to upgrade to a Pro. Audiophiles may want surround sound type thing, in which I'd recommend a Pro, but 2nd gen works well enough for me (until prices drop for some of the newer ones).","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AGLIW2ME2UMV6MELUQXKQEP6CDLA,True,9,Set: Without AppleCare+
R2QGEC3WRQRMLX,B07PXGQC1Q,5.0 out of 5 stars Very practical,renee,5,"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.","Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2023",AEYO6M357PGA7I2MHHB2FQ5FSDEA,True,158,Set: Without AppleCare+

R2RXIKIAXE4Z31,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Product,Misagp,4,"I tried many cheaper versions of bluetooth earbuds, but they are all touchy and annoyingly glitchy, compared to AirPods, which are just awesome! Pairs perfectly, just as most Apple products do. You can program them to do various things when you tap them, so you don't have to do everything through the phone. The voice recognition is very handy when driving and you need Siri to do something for you. The mic is a little quiet on phone calls, so I cup my hand to my mouth to direct sound to them when needed.After a while though, my left ear is sore from the shape of the earbud. It's probably just my ear shape. Still not interested in paying more for the smaller, more cushy ones. Hundreds of dollars is ridiculous.I recommend getting the little silicone case cover, as it helps you find the item, clip it to your phone, etc. Keep them clean, don't get them wet, don't store them in pockets and lose them. They seem to survive small drops. They do have a feature that makes noise to help you find them, but only if they still have some charge in their batteries.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AFZAUG5S6T5FHORGNTMQHNLQ6HZQ,True,0,Set: Without AppleCare+

These earbuds offer a lot of convenience and solid performance.Pros:Sound Quality: The audio quality is excellent, with clear highs and balanced mids. They’re great for listening to music, podcasts, and making phone calls.Seamless Connectivity: Pairing the AirPods with my iPhone and other Apple devices is incredibly smooth. The instant connection and switching between devices are standout features.Comfort and Fit: They fit comfortably in my ears and stay in place during workouts. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.Battery Life: The battery life is impressive. I get several hours of continuous use, and the charging case provides multiple additional charges, making them perfect for long days and travel.Siri Integration: Hands-free Siri access is a handy feature, allowing me to control music, make calls, and get information without needing to touch my phone.Cons:Lack of Noise Cancellation: Unlike the Pro version, these AirPods don’t have active noise cancellation. While they do a decent job of passive noise isolation, it’s not enough in noisy environments.Price: They’re a bit on the expensive side, especially considering the lack of noise cancellation. There are other earbuds with similar or better features at a lower price point.Fit May Vary: While they fit my ears well, I’ve heard from friends that they don’t fit everyone perfectly. It’s worth trying them on before committing to a purchase.In summary, the Apple AirPods 2nd Generation offer great sound quality, convenience, and battery life, making them a solid choice for anyone in the Apple ecosystem. While they lack some advanced features like noise cancellation, they still provide a fantastic listening experience and seamless integration with Apple devices.","Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2024",AH7LXZF3MXW5WLMCOOZJXPKU6NBQ,True,11,Set: Without AppleCare+

They definitely don’t hold a charge very well. The case does a great job charging the ear buds, but the buds themselves die very quickly. My only other complaint is that there is interference for absolutely no reason. At random times, you can’t get a clear connection, similar to a radio station not tuned completely in to a channel. Overall I think it’s a good value for the money, especially because most in ear headphones absolutely do not fit my ear.

RU386S548TUQ8,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Got these only because newer ear buds never fit my ears,MariaS,4,"Everyone knows that these are an old product from Apple. But I ordered other Apple or different brands of ear buds, and absolutely none of them felt comfortable in my small ear canals. Even the ones with multiple rubber things small enough to supposedly fit. All of the styles I had to return got far greater reviews for sound quality, and they all allow you to see the amount of battery charge left on the case.These earbuds have so-so sound quality, and I never use them for phone calls. So I can’t speak about that aspect. The choices of what you can tap on either the left or right side for are limited. Other ear phones or buds have multiple ways you can touch your right and left sides, to get sound levels, on/off, next track, answering phone, etc. The main thing these do is allow you to use Siri, as they are an Apple product, albeit several models “old.” The main drawback to these is that you cannot look at the case to see how much battery charge is left. You must open the case up when your Bluetooth area is open within your phone’s or iPads’ setting, in order for that to tell you the battery percentage for both the ear buds and the case which can charge them. That is kind of a pain. They do hold battery percentage fairly well, I can say.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2024",AE7T57CQOLJAYEZIWYZFIY4JO5EQ,True,4,Set: Without AppleCare+

Good battery life for a busy mom. make it through plane rides, a day of work etc. I bought a pink case so they're easy to find and more durable. Yesterday, suddenly, they stopped pairing. they charge fine, but are completely undiscoverable by any device, apple, non-apple, phone, pc, etc. after doing my own troubleshooting i reached out to support and did their trouble shooting who then sent me to a repair location. without Applecare, this would cost $19 for them to diagnose the issue then depending on what was broken, possibly $80+ to replace the part(s). I was told if it was one earbud that would be 80ish EACH and another 80 if the issue was the charging case. I bought these for $89... so it's just not economical.I will be repurchasing them. The tech at the repair store said an 18-24 month lifecycle is typically the max he sees for this product. I was considering applecare+ which is $30 for 2 years... however, the cost to replace a lost AirPod or the Charging Case is typically around $89 each without AppleCare+. With AppleCare+, accidental damage repairs, including replacements, are priced at $29 per incident. This fee applies to either the AirPods or the case. so 30+29=$59 and that's only if one piece is broken... not both or all three. i will not be purchasing Applecare for these airpods. I will keep the broken ones however, since the case charges fine, it will be nice to have that extra one just in case.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2024",AFDHBVIOC42RNMTZXHIHXHHS7WJQ,True,20,Set: Without AppleCare+

Nothing beats the convenience of using Apple AirPods with my Apple products. When I want to switch from device to device, boom... it happens. Every alternative gave me troubles switching between Apple devices. Is this a conspiracy set by Apple to discourage use of other brands? I don't know. What I can say is that these AirPods are also the most comfortable option I've tried. They are what my ears crave the most. I will not let their cravings go unheard ever again, and I will only purchase AirPods from here on out.","Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2024",AEA53V4TBMG4TTG3LAJQ3RPSFO3A,True,3,Set: Without AppleCare+

R2PSM90P4419GJ,B0CB9563MB,5.0 out of 5 stars By far the best I’ve used for cycling,kbs,5,"So happy I bought these! I’m an avid cyclist and I’ve used many headphones over the years. Cycling presents a couple of unique challenges for headphones:Wind Noise - always pretty deafening, which means to listen to anything (mostly audiobooks or podcasts for me), you have to crank the volume up to be able to hear over the wind noiseSecure fit - I usually have to push them in further many times during a ride because ear buds tend to work themselves out as you ride - both for fear of them falling out but alway for the wind noise - it gets worse when not fully insertedDurability - Cycling is surprisingly rough on ear buds- they don’t last very long. Probably because of the sweat, the temperature swings (I ride through the winter) and the rainWe’ll see how they do for durability, but they claim they are the toughest buds on the market. As for wind noise and fit, they are fantastic. They somehow stay firmly in place in my ears like no others that I’ve tried - without using any sort of earhooks. They just don’t move at all - which is great. Not once have i ever felt the need to push them in further during a ride. For wind noise, it is such a joy to have that substantially attenuated. Much better than the AirPod Pro’s (gone through 2 pairs) and the Soundcore Liberty 4’s I was using - all of which have failed in less than a year. I also have a pair of Sony WF-1000XM5’s, which are downright spooky in their ability to block out wind noise, but those are definitely not suited for cycling. It’s so nice to not have to crank up the volume to listen what I want to listen to! These are also the only earbuds I’ve ridden with where i could adjust the volume while riding. I love the feel of the buttons - they click, which I like more than the more common capacitive touch buttons on most others. Best app I’ve seen yet for any of my headphones. Sound quality is good, but definitely not in the same league as my Sony WF-1000XM5’s, but for cycling headphones I don’t care about that. Off the bike, I have a secondary use for these - to block out my wife’s snoring at night. They excel at that job as well - the noise cancelling is very powerful - not too far short of my Sony’s, but easily enough to block out the snoring. But the fit is a surprising benefit here as well as on the bike - i don’t have to worry at all about them falling out while im sleeping, which is not the case with any of my other earbuds. They are also supremely comfortable - i can barely even tell that I’m wearing them - which is a big deal if you intend to sleep with them. Lastly, battery life is excellent. With noise cancelling on, they easily make it through the night (which my AirPod Pro’s could not do). We’ll see how they hold up for durability, but if Jabra’s claims are true about these being the toughest earbuds around, they should hold up. Incredibly happy with these - HIGHLY recommended, and for cyclists, the best you can buy!","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AFGBD3JWIQZ2RLVSCNC6U6WXNR4A,True,10,Style: Elite 8 ActiveColor: Dark Grey
R1M4DS5H7T99TX,B0CB9563MB,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great earbuds, after extensive evaluation, rated over Beats Fit Pro",Abraham Cohn,5,"After trying a few sets of cheaper earbuds with the earloop for fitness use, I was very dissatisfied with the flat/muted sound quality, as well as their enormous cases, and decided to evaluate a couple of the top ranked items.#1 Fitness Earbuds ranked by CNET: Beats Fit Pro#1 Fitness Earbuds ranked by SoundGuys: Jabra Elite 8 ActiveI evaluated many aspects that were of importance to me, and ultimately chose the Jabra Elite 8 Active. Your choice may depend on what factors are most important to you.Below is the analysis, showing the winner for each category:================================================Charging PodBeats: Larger than necessary, charging pod seems flimsy, requires 2 hands to open lid. Charging light is only white. When charging is complete, if you open the lid there is no indication level of the case charge level as empty or anything else.Jabra: Nice compact charging pod, fits easily in pocket. Feels really high quality and solid. Lid can be flipped open with one hand. LED indicator is Green/Yellow/Red for charge level of both case and buds, and purple when it is doing a firmware update.Winner: Jabra – big win================================================In ear comfortBeats: Easy to place in ear, very comfortable and no concern about them falling out. After some time wearing them, the wing tip did cause some pressure on my ear with minor irritation. When wearing a thick winter hat, putting it on caused the buttons to be pressed, for example pausing the music – this is annoying.Jabra: Very comfortable, although it takes a bit to get used to the in ear canal pressure. Amazing that they don’t fall out. At first I was concerned they would, but even after active manuevers and facial gestures like big grin, it did not loosen them. After some time got used to the fact that they really aren’t going to fall out. More slim in ear and does not press a button when putting on a winter hat.Winner: Jabra – small win. Although the Beats are slightly more comfortable, the slim fit and ability to work better with a hat makes Jabra win out.================================================SoundBeats: Great sound, punchy bass, clear sound. After a while, the bass is a bit too much for me, but it is a personal preference. I wanted something a bit less bass overwhelming.Jabra: Great sound, a bit more balanced – not overpowering bass. Also, the Sound+ app has a built-in EQ with customizable presets, so you can boost bass a bit more, and overall get a very solid sound!Winner: Jabra – big win – with more balanced sound and EQ capability built-in to app with customizable settings.================================================Control customizabilityBeats: App allows some limited customization, but it requires left and right ear to have the same control. For example, double tap is next track, triple tap is previous track. You have to pick whether you want voice assistant or ANC adjustment, you cannot have both controls available.Jabra: Amazing customization, you can have different controls in left and right side, for example, right double tap is next track and left double tap for previous track, but it is fully adjustable. On Android, if you use the built-in voice assistant, you can have BOTH voice assistant and volume controls AND the ANC adjustment. Unfortunately, if you set to Google Assistant, which functions different and better than using the Android default assistant (even if that is set to Google), then you cannot also have volume controls, but you still get ANC button control.Winner: Jabra – big win with much greater customization ability and more flexibility.================================================Control button feelBeats: Physical button, fully silent, you cannot hear it at all when pressing. At first this seemed a good thing, but after a while you wish for some more recognizable confirmation that the button was pressed.Jabra: A physical button with a small mechanical click that is heard, but not loud enough that it is annoying. Earbuds that have a virtual button that you have to thump the earbud have a much louder sound that is annoying. These buds have a pleasant faint audible click.Both are much better than buds with a touch surface and not a mechanical button, because my experience is touching those types of ear buds hard enough to detect a press causes a louder thump sound in your ear, and the press is less reliable than a mechanical click.Winner: Jabra – big win for small audible click sound, and also a button that is not accidentally pressed as easily.================================================EQBeats: Presumably if you have a Beats Fit Pro you are using Apple Music, and then you can use the EQ in Apple Music. This EQ is horrible – the sound is much quieter, none of the presets sound as good as EQ off, and there is no customizable EQ that you can save. Thumbs down. Tested on Android.Jabra: As mentioned above, the EQ built into the Sound+ app is very nice and allows custom presets. It sounds great.Winner: Jabra – big win for good built-in EQ================================================Firmware updates via Android phoneBeats: When I got the buds, they needed a firmware update. It took about 5 minutes with a progress bar to download to the buds case. It then notified me that the update would continue in the background and I could use the buds. It took almost 24 hours until they finally updated, and meanwhile the app showed this pending message and didn’t allow access to any of the app functionality. Very annoying and unclear if something was wrong or if it would ever finish updating.Jabra: When I got the buds, they needed a firmware update. This process was seamless and took about a couple minutes total. It downloaded first to the buds case from the app. The case then flashed purple to show it was updating, and with the buds in the case it then completed the update in less than a couple minutes. I was shocked after the terrible experience with the Beats Fit Pro.Winner: Jabra – major win for clear status and fast update================================================SupportBeats; When the buds were ‘stuck’ updating, I chatted with Apple support, and after wasting more than an hour of my life, they told me that my brand new buds were out of warranty, I would have to go to a service center and pay for a diagnostic to figure out the problem. No clue or experience with this issue, even though I pointed the tech to an Apple moderated discussion thread with 192 “me too” responses for this exact issue of pending update on the firmware. Their response was this was a customer forum and they don’t handle issues there. Ridiculous to not be aware in your support system of that many complaints on your own discussion threads. I was livid angry by the time I ended the support call. I told the support staff I would make sure to share my experience and advise other users not to buy these earbuds, and that I would be promptly returning mine.Jabra: After disabling the Google Assistant in order to activate volume controls, I tried to activate the assistant again and it wouldn’t turn back on, so I contacted support. There was a form to fill out and they got back to me by e-mail the next morning, with a set of solution steps. Actually their solution did not cover the solution needed to fix this (I found it online – you need to uninstall the Google app updates, then reinstall, and then the Google assistant can be linked to the buds again. However, I responded to them with a different issue about the assistant functionality, and they quickly replied with a phone number to call to better assist me. I did not end up calling. So although they did not solve my actual issue, it was a far less annoying experience.Winner: Jabra – big win as Apple failed miserably by denying the complaints of 192 users on their discussion forum and telling me my brand new buds were not covered by warranty.================================================Ruggedness / water proofingBeats: IPX4 – this is a miserable rating. Not dust proof, and lightly splash resistant. Will not resist significant sweat, and case is not wet proof either, do not put wet buds in it. Not sure how a set of fitness earbuds can survive at IPX4.Jabra: Buds are IP68 – dust proof and water proof to 1 m for 30 minutes. Case is IP54 – dust and splash protection. I’ve tried them in the shower and the work absolutely fine.Winner: Jabra – big win, actually waterproof================================================ANCBeats: Excellent ANC, and easy to turn on or switch to transparent mode with a single button pressJabra: Good ANC, and single button press to switch to hear through mode. This mode is very good, but barely detectable tinny sound vs. Beats that sound amazing in transparent modeWinner: Beats – minor win for slightly better sound quality in transparent/hear through mode. Both are excellent.================================================CallsBeats: You need to manually select the ANC mode for calls. Sounds great, and it does seem to provide the side tone which means you can hear your own voice (not muffled) to me this is a deal breaker for headphones that do not sound clear like this because I cannot talk well when my own voice sounds muffled. However, the call quality hearing others is excellent.Jabra: These automatically switch to ANC on during calls, but the Sound+ app lets you customize the volume level of the side tone that is heard. So even though ANC is on, you hear your own voice clearly which is excellent.Winner: Beats – minor win for stellar sound quality during calls. Jabra sound is still quite acceptable.================================================WidgetsBeats: Requires to know your location all the time even when not using the app. Has a widget to show battery level and select ANCJabra: “widget” is within the App, and you can customize what widgets you want to see there such as EQ, ANC, battery level, etc. Requires to know your location all the time even when not using the app (in order to find the buds if they are lost). Sometimes the app has trouble connecting to the buds which means you can’t adjust the EQ. To solve this, I found putting the buds back in the case and then putting them back on solves it.Winner: Toss up – more widget functionality in Jabra, but some issues connecting, solved by putting buds back in case then taking them out again. Found that doing a force stop on the app when this happens solves it, and the problem hasn’t happened recently.================================================Overall, I chose the Jabra Elite 8 Active over the Beats Fit Pro because primarily the following factors: more compact and better feeling case, more balanced sound and much better EQ with custom presets, support system that did not make me irate, better waterproofing rating. Both sets of buds comfortably stayed in my ears and worked well for phone calls. Price was not a major factor, but additionally the Jabra buds were significantly cheaper.","Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2024",AHAVOQ3NASNAGPUVXSEUU4RHAY2A,True,39,Style: Elite 8 ActiveColor: Dark Grey
R3TYVMVG9DE644,B0CB9563MB,4.0 out of 5 stars So so happy :) yet disappointed :(,Vlad Stefanovic,4,"Absolutely perfect for it's intended use! In fact, the best I've ever found. But...I've been a Jabra fan for a few years. First, Elite 75T and then 85T. No earbud is awesome at everything but 85T was the best overall pic for features important to me. One big exception, exercise.I've been on a hunt for the best budget earbuds for when active and after a long journey, all roads brought me back home to Jabra. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something I wouldn't use all day long. I was simply looking for something that would stay well in my ears, have a good sound and loud volume. But then the Cyber Monday happened so I couldn't resist going slightly over budget. And I'm so freaking glad!Elite 8 Actives go in ear with ease and just stay in! They don't feel big or tight in the ear yet they seal super well and require a nice pull to come out. I don't know precisely how Jabra accomplished this but I don't care, all I know is that it's flawless for me! The volume goes up quite high as long as Spacial Audio is not on. I am not an audiophile but I find the sound of these fantastic! I use the Energize EQ setting as my favorite for 90% of what I listen to. Call quality has been great for callers on the other end. ANC is pretty good.So why 4 stars instead of 5...Mostly due to the app downgrade. With a newer product, one could hope that you would get what used to be, plus some upgrades. But instead, now it's less...1. With 85Ts, the Sound+ app has the MySound feature. It's where both ears can get tested individually for which frequencies they may or not be able to hear. And the app adjusts them for each ear accordingly. Incredible feature for some of us who may have slight hearing issues with one or both ears. Blows my mind that Jabra would take that away on both 8 Active and Elite 10. It made such a huge difference for me.2. When on a call, I am no longer able to toggle between ANC/Hearthrough/Off modes by pressing the button on the left earbud. Not sure why Jabra would assume that I would automatically want ANC when on a call ugh... Just can't fathom why that decision was made for both Elite 8 Active and Elite 10. 3. No more Sound modes. Unlike 85T, the app does not offer 3 fully customizable modes for Elite 8 Active and Elite10. It's a bummer.All this being said... Elite 8 Actives deliver exactly as described and promoted by Jabra. My complaints are strictly based on what I was previously accustomed to and should not be relevant to anyone considering a Jabra product for the first time. If you are looking for a solid set of comfortable earbuds that stay well in ears, offer awesome sound, battery life and call quality as well as pretty good ANC, I'm quite confident that you will love the Jabra Elite 8 Active especially if you're someone who is very active. Oh and of course, actual buttons rather than fidgety, hypersensitive touch controls? Yeah, it's awesome....

R25OCSRUWPUVCX,B0CB9563MB,5.0 out of 5 stars Best earbuds I've owned (after nearly a dozen),Guy,5,"These are by far and away the best earbuds I've ever owned.#1 They fit flush in the ears and I can sleep on them (for flights)#2 The battery life is enough for most trips, and they charge reliably in the carrying case (not all do)#3 Passthrough sound isn't marvelous, but it works#4 Noise cancelling isn't the world's greatest, but it does well#5 Connection is rock solid. I never have a distance issue. They work further than my Bose headset, which is great. Sometimes, only one earbud will connect (you can use one at a time if you want, which is also nice) but simply replacing both in the case, and then pulling them back out again guarantees both will connect, every time (second time, every time ;)#6 The carrying case is USB C. They should all be by now, but some cheaper models still aren't.#7 The microphone is outstanding. Small background sounds aren't heard by parties on the other end of the line, neither are mild chewing sounds from the wearer. In short, they are the best web meeting headset I've ever used, and they're earbuds.#8 They can handle multiple connections and seamlessly switch. They do a very good job at this as well.#9 You can run with them in and they don't fall out. I can shake my head violently and they manage to stay in. I would have to really work to shake them out.

R2XN5V9ZKK3CQA,B0CB9563MB,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic earbuds,RyanD,5,"As background, I primarily use earbuds for exercising (weightlifting, cycling, circuit training, etc) so the most important thing to me is that they stay in my ears no matter how drenched in sweat I get. I’ve used many different earbuds over the years and these are by far my favorite and have well surpassed my expectations.Fit: The coating on the earbuds makes them feel glued into place even when sweaty, fit is snug but very comfortable, have had zero issues with these right out of the box.Battery life: These things just won’t die. Have been using daily (2 hours on average) for about two weeks on one full charge and the case is still at 50% (using ANC the entire time). I haven’t had to use yet but the quick charge feature is a fantastic addition.Sound quality: I won’t claim to be an audiophile but I do love music and IMO these have great range for what they are and far surpass my ancient galaxy buds and much newer airpod pros. ANC completely eliminates all distracting gym noises (inconsiderate people talking on their phones, group fitness instructors yelling and playing crappy music, etc), and the pass thru mode works great as well if you’re working out with a partner or need to hear your surroundings (e.g., cycling). The app has a nice equalizer function that lets you set custom presets, in addition to the standard ones that come preloaded.Other notable features:Very long range - bluetooth connectivity does not drop even when all the way across a crowded gym from my phone.Case is nice and compact and works with wireless charging.The app allows you to highly customize the controls on each earbud and has the option to use just one earbud at a time which is nice to have if you plan to use for calls. Note that I don’t use earbuds much for calls so can’t really comment on call quality.Bottom line, if you’re looking for comfortable earbuds that won’t fall out, will last you weeks between charges, have all the latest techy features and sound great…you will love these.","Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2024",AFUWDHJVJHGFPEOVH3SJACCNVVXQ,True,22,Style: Elite 8 ActiveColor: Dark Grey

These are the most comfortable one that I have ever worn. They also barely peek outside my ear, which is spectacular.The sound quality is pretty good, deep base, clear tones, equalizer, spatial audio etc. Very comparable to my Beats Fit Pro (those lasted me two years before the wings tore up).I rated these 4/5 on Sound Quality only because It is not a Bose quality sound, but then again, I can only enjoy the Bose while they stay in my ear and not fall out.

Bought these to replace my Google Pixel Buds that died and weren't good for distance running (and the associated sweat) anyway. For the Jabra Elite Active 8...Pros: Good sound, good battery life, wireless charging, waterproof/sweat-proof, secure fit, ability to switch between active noise cancelling and transparency modes. Last but not least: physical buttons rather than touch controls that become ineffective when wet with rain or sweat.Cons: The control layout. It is really annoying that the buttons cannot be configured so that both earbuds can do ALL of the following: pause/play, skip forward, rewind, toggle between ANC and transparency modes, and trigger Google Assistant. I often wear earbuds in mono mode and it is really annoying that some controls are on the other earbud. Also, I do not like that the Google Assistant button prompts Google Assistant to read my notifications (a feature I've never liked) rather than simply wakes Google Assistant to listen for a voice command.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2024",AHXMX75CLIUWHKAC2CSYAVYLWHAQ,True,0,Style: Elite 8 ActiveColor: Dark Grey
R1HPJXJ2WYMU0M,B0CB9563MB,4.0 out of 5 stars Definitely worth the consideration...!!!,Eddie Landsberg,4,"I lost my left Air Pod pro (again!) and Apple's FIND MY app is useless... so thought about possibly trying the competition. (I love APPLE, but find their customer service off putting, even though I like the design of their products.)Went and got this one after purchasing a Jabra a few years ago that had pairing issues, so I gave up on it. (Fast forward a few years...)This product is simply amazing -- albeit clearly a different concept. Whereas the AirPods go for a natural sound and feel, this product creates a ""beefy"" immersive feel (Dolby option included) -- to say the sound is ""multi-directional"" is almost an understatement. Coupled with the noise counseling feature, you can literally play it at a much lower volume than you would AirPods and still feel immersed. The bass is bassy, the highs are crisp, and there's EQ to adjust.As for the feel of the buds themselves -- I have really small ear drums and felt that Apple's AirPods were always dropping out of my ear. The smallest and slightly larger size fit me just right. These are also a bit bulkier, which also makes tapping the button to pair easier. One other great point is that the built in mic is definitely in a league of its own.Any complaints? I think it boils down to a few minor details. First, Apple may have them beat slightly on the noise cancellation, but I live in NYC, and maybe being totally blocked out from my surroundings isn't so wise anyway. That said, the great sound relies heavily on compression, which may or may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the idea here is that you can play it at a much softer volume and get a really nice tasty listen. The apple product might have a bit more dimensionality, this makes up for it in taste.All in all, considering that I paid the same price for this as I would have to repurchase the AirPods Pro my verdict is that I made the right choice for me... although I imagine that there are some people who might go the other way, and furthermore, I might even enjoy switching between both products on occasion.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AHYX3SGNZ4HFLTNA5CWZHCIEZRDA,True,1,Style: Elite 8 ActiveColor: Dark Grey
R1VKMIDYE0WFT7,B0CB9563MB,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing fit with good audio, okay ANC and hearthrough",Amazon Customer,4,"Prior to buying these earphones I owned the Jabra Elite 75t, which I loved. I always have issues finding earphones that stay in my ear and the Jabra brand seems to be the best fit I can find.Compared to the 75t these fit even better and stay regardless of activity or facial movement. I used to have to adjust the 75t every so often when talking or running but these don't need any adjusting, which is fantastic.Sound is about the same with these compared to the 75t. These earphones are extremely bass heavy and require adjustment through the Jabra sound+ app to even them out a little bit. Once adjusted, the audio is great.The ANC and hearthrough on these is actually worse compared to the 75t. The hearthrough is tinny. The ANC does not block out noise as well as I was hoping but I listen to my music pretty loud while working out so that's not a deal breaker for me.Overall I would recommend these earphones, especially for the fit. There's nothing worse than having to constantly adjust while working out and these prevent that issue. The sound and other options are good enough that I can overlook the flaws with the ANC and hearthrough.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AGLUHGTRTWSF446ID4IBXUWRZ2IA,True,0,Style: Elite 8 ActiveColor: Dark Grey

The Elite 8 also doesn't have the status indicator LEDs anymore. Only the charging case has it now.I'd recommend the Elite 7 Active over the Elite 8 if you can find them. Sound quality is basically the same, battery life is similar, and both come with USB-C charging cases w/ wireless charging. But the Elite 7 Active could be had at a lower price.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sound. They’re not as good as my Sennheiser buds, but they’re certainly better than average. The noise cancellation works well.

Airpod Pros, Beats studio buds, galaxy buds, you name it. I've tried some of the most highly reviewed earbuds on the market, and these seriously blow them all out of the water.First: THEY STAY IN. I tested this immediately upon receiving them by shaking my head from side to side so vigorously my glasses flew off. Earbuds stayed in. I have since used them for working out (HIIT weightlifting and vinyasa yoga). I cleaned them once (wiped them down with an alcohol wipe) cause I felt like I probably should, but it came away super clean. Sorcery???Second: The sound quality is like I'm streaming music directly to my brain. Noise cancellation isn't the best I've ever used, but it's enough that I can listen to a podcast while blow-drying my hair in the morning with no issues. They're also completely waterproof, and as a regular earbud washer, I appreciate this. I don't know for sure if I've sent them through the wash yet, but I suspect that's where my lost left earbud is.Third: I only have pain with these when I wear them for 4+ hours, which is arguably too long to be wearing in-ear headphones anyway.Finally, and best of all: These have an auto-shutoff feature. This means when I finally find my left earbud, I can long press the (REAL, PHYSICAL, EASY TO USE) button and it'll *theoretically* be good to go.10/10, Jabra.","Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2024",AHPKAGP6OAERA2O4SQRMSZ3ZCZAQ,True,2,Style: Elite 8 ActiveColor: Dark Grey

At the same time, I have had multiple failures of other earbuds from similar use.Pros:- Compared to past versions, the Jabra Elite Active earbuds are now more comfortable, stay put better in the ear, offer improved in-app features, and do not cause excess pressure.- Handle sweat and movement better than other similarly priced or more expensive earbuds.- More comfortable than at least 1/2 the competing earbuds.- Noise Canceling works better than expected (not as good as Bose or Airpods but still really, really good for the price and durability)- Durable- Buttons/ Controls are easy to use and have more features compared to other budsCons:- When using these earbuds, it may be necessary to adjust the EQ/ sound settings depending on the type of media and device being used.- Sometimes it is annoying to put it back into the case (but no more than most earbuds)Considerations:- The features and app work well for iPhone. Still, suppose you have your listening preferences set up for something such as music (increased base/ treble). In that case, you can get a tin-like/ rough listening experience for mostly speech audio listening.

Sound wise impressed and even on lower codecs it's still good enough and great bass but of course 10s better than 8 but not too much. Fit wise the 8s fit better as 10s felt like were barely in and hanging on but 8s go deeper into the canal as the tip goes out a little more and it proved when exercising. App is good but wish more settings on the main page instead of going into other sections but features are good and controls with the button. App sometimes takes more than a few seconds to connect to buds so that's a con with other buds connecting faster. Multipoint also works great. My other buds are Technics AZ80, Airpods Pro and I used to have Sony XM4 so for ANC is not as good as those but still ""enough"" and Transparency is a little muffled and not crystal clear but also enough but my other buds were better. Overall, a good pair of buds but I settled on the Elite 8s for fit and are my workout buds while Technics are my main music buds and commute, I don't have my Sony's anymore but my Airpods remain for work and calls.

The clickable push type buttons are customizable and perfect for controlling the buds and your music on the fly while running, like volume, play/stop, rewind/f-forward, noise cancelling on/off, etc., rather than touch/swipe controls which are terrible for running, especially on colder days if you are wearing gloves or have a beanie over the ears. Batteries also last a LONG time, for the whole time before a marathon, the whole marathon, and after the marathon. The case is perfect for carrying if you need even more time.

I managed to leave my new Jabra 8 Actives (both buds & case) in my hoodie pocket and then ran them through an entire wash cycle, start to finish. Opened the case and the both lights glowed green. Shook out the buds and put them in my ears. They did not miss a beat! (Pun intended.) I have used them enough after this to be comfortable that they are completely fine. Additionally, I have owned two sets of Jabra 65t actives. I am very please with the sound and quality of these 8 actives. Sound seems to be a slight improvement over the 65ts which is not a complaint. I thought the 65ts were great. Battery life was my first priority and these have surpassed expectations. I have used them with anc off for 12 hours and they still were not dead before charging again. Battery life with anc on has not disappointed either but I have not tested that as thoroughly. They are smaller & lighter the 65t actives. Fit my ear very, very well. The app has additional settings that were not available with my older pair, another plus. Hear through works well also. If I have one complaint it is the Dolby Spatial Sound that can be toggled on/off. I do not like and do not use it. It seems like it was just away to attach the Dolby name as a selling point. Wrap up; I personally wanted a set of buds with great, quality sound and the best battery life that I could find. Jabra 8 active definitely checks those boxes (and others) for me. The small disappointment with the Dolby setting is far outweighed by the washing machine factor.

Eventually, they both connect and power on. It's very irritating. But not as irritating as the fact they won't stay in my ears. Even sitting still at my desk, I have to constantly readjust them and push them back in my ear. I lift weights very intensely. Every time I grunt or grimace while lifting something very heavy, they literally pop out of my ears. This happens 4-5 times every workout. And yes, I've tried all the different sizes of tips.

Twenty five years ago an ear infection in my left ear took out 80% of my hearing in that ear. While the brain is remarkably good at accommodating the loss, I have never heard the full sound stage, including high frequencies in the left ear until these ear buds. They fit perfectly right out of the box without spending hours trying to get the gels correct. They stay in better than any of the prior buds (including the 65T). I haven't tried the ANC and after using the Elite 7 active earbuds, I don't have high expectations of effective noise cancelling. I will just use my Sony WH 1000 XM4 on airplanes.

ANC is very well implemented.Updated review: There is a major problem in that the right ear bud regularly discharges while in the case. So when you go to use the earbuds they only have 10% battery (left won't work w/o right), and don't last long. Not only does this suck but it will wear out one of the two buds much more quickly with the full discharges. It is somehow staying on or connected in the case and discharging instead of charging.But: Initially volume control didn't work. That's because the ""hold for one second"" needed to increase volume on the right was mapped to Google Assistant. For some reason they lock that mapping in the controls so you can't undo it! This is despite the manual also saying ""double tap left ear for voice assistant"".What you need to do is change the assistant in the Jabra App from ""Google Assistant"" to ""Android Default"" (which is apparently just a search?). Then everything works fine, except for Google Assistant. SO STUPID, particularly when coupled with locking that control.

But when the battery life finally degraded, I decided to upgrade to these.I had these for about a month and loved them. They had incredible noise canceling capabilities and had great music quality. Even though I found the 75ts really comfortable, these was somehow even better. But one thing I noticed as a negative was the quality of the case. The case opened up much more easily and it was clear that the magnets, for both the lid and the earbud spaces, were much weaker. Other reviews have also noted this issue.Just a few weeks after getting them, I dropped my case one night while walking. As soon as the case hit the ground, it opened up and sent the earbuds flying. I searched for the earbuds for quite some time but never found them.After using the 75ts for years, I’m very disappointed by the decreased quality of this case. Even after dropping the 75ts, the earbuds always stayed securely in place. In the years a I had the 75ts, this was never an issue. But this newer model has sacrificed security and I ultimately paid the price by losing the earbuds. I am disappointed to see that the quality of the case has degraded, despite a clear improvement to the earbuds themselves.I can’t justify buying a replacement pair when I’ll now have to worry about losing the earbuds again.

Those were the ultimate in sport earbud: fit, noise cancelling, and durability. However, the case was the Achilles heel, and probably something Logitech didn't want to fix (thus the discontinuation.)I had heard great things about the Jabra Elite line of earbuds but was sorely disappointed. On at least three occasions (running, cycling, and simply walking around the kitchen, bending down to get a pan or something else), the earbuds came out of my ear canal. What's worse, after getting what I thought was the correct fit using the included earbud adjustment kit, they still fell out.On sound: I use the earbuds during activity but also on my morning commute for language practice. While music playback seemed good (some incidental noise came through the noise cancelling feature), the spoken word in these earbuds sounds like its coming through a tin can.

I always upgrade to the latest and this time was a tremendous disappointment. Each upgrade has entailed better sound, longer battery, better ANC. This time around, only battery life seemed to improve while sound and ANC declined. Then the battery case design came into play and battery life became a misnomer. The advantage of the 7 and under (besides wireless charging) is that they lay flat to enable the contacts to connect. The case of the 8 does not. And when the connects don’t connect not only do they not charge but they also auto connect to my devices. Annoying. Add to that going to use them for the gym and they are out of battery.Go with the 7 or under. Until Jabra can fix this issue or design reliable cases.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AEWWVUHYSAIBI46IBEIFX4GBQJRQ,True,1,Style: Elite 8 ActiveColor: Dark Grey

You also lose the ability to test the fit for sound leakage, which can affect ANC performance. Hopefully, the lack of customization options is due to these being a new product and not a conscious decision by Jabra to dumb-down the feature set in search of greater profitability.

Bad enough to bring anxiety attacks. I was hesitant to buy these because of the price. I tried other ear buds but they did not cancel anything enough. My hubs demanded I buy these and so I did and good lord the peace these have brought me. What sound does make it through is dampened so much that it's barely there and no longer triggers me. I cannot believe that these little things can block SO MUCH. They are so comfortable that I forget I have them in and the cool little bands they have around the bud keeps them in. They ain't going nowhere! They weigh NOTHING. Easy to get them in and remove. I love that the volume control is a swipe on the side of the bud. Also you can tap three times to repeat a song! I find them very good with phone calls too (android). They are VERY sensitive to my touch commands. I don't have to mash the hell out of them to get them to pause, skip or go back.Music and audio books sound brilliant!! I find that the sound from the buds does not have to do battle with any background noise making for an awesome experience. Every other pair of earbuds I have had including Sony's has had to do battle with background noise because they could not cancel squat at my workplace.On the connection issue, I had it. The left one stopped syncing. I tried twice to fix it and twice it stopped syncing. I was a sad panda and almost returned them until my hubs told me the left bud syncs with the right bud so if I was taking the left one out first ( I was taking them both out at the same time), it could be causing an issue. I reset the whole thing. Then I started taking the right on out first and putting it in my ear and waiting for the, battery at blah blah percent prompt then the tone that tells you that it's on. Then I take the left one out of the case and put it in and I have never had another problem and I waited a over solid month of nearly everyday use before I posted this. Not one more problem. If you are reluctant about this issue, just remember you can always return them and get your money back if you can't fix the issue. It's freaking worth a try!!! This is an amazing life altering product that has made an ENORMOUS difference in my anxiety level due to constant bombardment of NOISE.On battery life. At work I keep the earbud case plugged in. When I go on break and lunch, I put them back in the case to charge. I have never had the battery run out on me. I am there for 9 hours.In my opinion these are worth every damn cent. I cannot be without them now. Just remember to take the right one out first and put it in your ear and wait for the tone that tells you it's on. Only then take the left one out.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2023",AEYU23YL74N5DVNNDC3JSB46XWHQ,True,177,Color: Triple Black

R347URO8ZWP4L5,B0B4PSQHD5,"1.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED REVIEW: Returned, just within the return window",ejbleen,1,"UPDATED REVIEW: Returned to Amazon.Multiple problems cropped up after several days.1) Only the right bud would work.2) The accompanying app refused to acknowledge the existence of my iPad - the iPad that I've used with the buds since I got them. iPad Settings could see the buds, but couldn't connect to them.3) Finally, this morning the buds could ""see"" but would not connect to my Dell Win11 laptop, with which they've worked since I bought them.I did the usual stuff: forget and repair, reset the buds, blah, blah, blah. As you'll understand if you read my original 3 1/2-star review, there is little about Bose support for this device that would tempt me to believe that contacting the company would be any use at all.When the buds work, the sound is good. But my entire user experience has suggested from the start that there is something very wrong with Bose's management of this product, from its design to its documentation and support. This is not a $200+ product - at least, not in my experience. In fairness, your experience may, of course, be different.BTW, the link to the online English user manual for this product is still in French. When I looked at it more closely, I realized that it is not even for the QC buds - it's for some amplifier or other! If I were responsible for product support at Bose, I'd be making it my business to see that Amazon reviews of my product were read and acted on by someone at the company. This relatively minor problem with the online user manual suggests that Bose doesn't read our reviews .... :(ORIGINAL REVIEW: These were my replacement for my Jabra Elite Pro 7 wireless buds, the left of which gave out less than a year after I bought them (just like it did for many unfortunate purchasers).Let me talk about the pros of the Bose earbuds first:1) Excellent fit in the ears;2) Excellent, full, warm sound (though I qualify this a little below);3) Ability to connect to up to 8 devices. The buds remember those devices, so the moment you select the Bose earbuds in your device Bluetooth app they'll connect. Easier than either of my Jabra sets;4) Magnetic, so won't fall out of case;5) Can be ""recognized"" by your device as soon as you open the case - you don't need to take them out;6) Friends says that the call quality on their end is excellent;7) Works fine with Windows devices - something that Jabra still doesn't seem to be able to do;8) The buds appear to remember your various settings even if you use them with a device that doesn't have the app. Very good!9) You can use one earbud (e.g. for phone calls);10) Noise canceling is excellent.A word here about the sound quality, which I wouldn't class as either a pro or a con. The buds seem to me to be very bass-heavy, but in saying that I'm aware that the tight fit of this sort of earbud design is so much a part of bass response that it might be my fit, though it is entirely comfortable, is too tight. I run the bass end of the equalizer at about -4 (db? - there's no volume unit specified).OK, now having said that, the bass response seems to me to extend way down the spectrum in the orchestral music that I listen to. You can almost feel the resonance of the bows on the double-basses, or the movement of the air when the bass drum is struck. Far and away more satisfying than any other in-ear phones, wireless or wired.Now for the cons. Some of these are simply eccentric design decisions. Some of them suggest sloppiness in overall product management or integration into the overall product experience.1) The fit in the case is peculiar. Getting them out requires an odd pinching of forefinger and thumb, and I can't take out the left bud with my right fingers - I have to use the left hand. Similarly, stowing the buds isn't intuitive at all, either in the left-right axis or top-bottom axis. I'll probably get used to it, but it's definitely a little strange. I have the glossy black ones, so there are no tell-tale shadows in the case to guide the eye;2) There doesn't seem to be any obvious way of determining how they work when you first open the package. There's a small QR code, but that gives information about installation, not use. If you go to the Bose website (at the time of my writing this review) and download the user guide in English, it turns out to be in French! And at least one of the web links from the app is dead.3) Controlling the buds involves touching the outside of the buds in various ways: brief touch, long touch, or a slide of the finger. This has the advantage of being ""solid-state"", as opposed to a clickable switch that can wear out. But the buds sit far enough out from the ears that knowing exactly where that ""touchable"" area is to be found can be difficult. And that is a problem, because a tentative slide (change the volume) can be interpreted as a touch (stop/start) - you need to be confident.4) The app is poorly designed. Here's an example: You can connect the buds using your regular Bluetooth connection, although the app supposedly will do it for you. If you have connected without using the app, however, then the app doesn't know you've connected ... and you won't be able to do anything else with the app until that connection takes place. And I've not found out yet how to delete the ""Work"" profile I created at the app's suggestion ....5) There is a young woman in my earbuds, and when she talks to me about battery strength she sounds bored to death. I'm not surprised, since she insists on telling the the name of the device I've connected to, and the default name of Windows devices is a long and incomprehensible string of gibberish ....OK, here's the summary.I like the sound and the fit, and I'm glad I bought them.However, the overall attention to the user experience doesn't suggest Bose to me, or any sort of premium product for that matter. At $149 they'd be a no-brainer. At their present price, which suggests a luxury experience, I think they're too expensive.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2023",AEEMV746AV6KAY2W64D72OPKGGDQ,True,303,Color: Triple Black
R3SJJD9Y53KJI7,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars Thrilled with my first pair of wireless earbuds.,P.S. Noonan,5,"This is my very first purchase of wireless earbuds (well, I purchased 3 others at same time, to compare them to each other). I did a decent amount of research in a short period of time, and landed on three of the highest rated. These, the Sony WF-1000XM4 and the Beats Fit Pro. I'll start by stating that I haven't felt compelled enough to actually write a review in years. I was so afraid these would disappoint me based on other reviews and Reddit threads, but after just a couple minutes listening to music with these and the Sony earbuds - I had determined an easy winner. I didn't even bother opening the Beats Fit Pro because I knew there was no way they wound better than Bose. My previous earbuds were Bose Soundsport (a gift from someone), so maybe I just have some bias because I'm accustomed to the sound that Bose delivers. My only other prior experience with ANC wireless earbuds is Apple Airpods Pro (I think first generation?) and all I remember when I tried them is instantly thinking the music quality wasn't even close to my Soundsport. Which is a good segue into my Pros and Cons list.PROS:1. Sound/Music quality. I'm not educated on all the components of sound/music, I don't know the exact science of what's what, I only know what sounds good to me. I know when music sounds ""full bodied"" and that's how I'd describe these/the Bose sound. The bass especially. I love Bose bass.1. Comfort. One of my biggest gripes with the Bose Soundsport was the fit/the wing tips. I HATE the wing tips, even with the smallest size they would cause soreness in my left ear in less than hour. In contrast, I LOVE the way these fit/feel. I have worn them for 3+ hours with zero discomfort. And that's with the size that they came with, I haven't even tried the other sizes yet to see if they can be even more comfortable.2. Noise Cancelling. Again, I'm not highly educated/experienced in this area (Soundsport didn't have ANC), but I can tell these do it well. I blow-dried my hair while listening to music and I couldn't hear the blowdryer at all (I did have my music up to max/near max volume), but still. I did try to compare this feature with Sony's, and either Sony's ANC was malfunctioning (I researched and troubleshooted), or it was just really bad in comparison to Bose.3. Easy set-up/sync. Scanned a QR code, downloaded the app, and boom, I was connected. I've had zero connection issues. (I have a Galaxy S21+).4. Aesthetic. I like how they look. I didn't like the weird knob thingy on the Sony, and I don't like the very obvious ""b"" Beats logo that's on the Bits Fit Pro, so I am extra grateful that I ended up liking these the most, because I also like how they look the most.CONS:1. Hiss/static noise. One of the biggest complaints I saw people have with these is the faint static/hiss noise (when no music/sound is playing), particularly when in Aware mode (ANC turned off). And yes, mine make the noise, and it can be heard even if music is playing at a very low volume, and yes it's annoying, but when I considered how infrequently I would have my earbuds in but not have any music/sound playing (or have volume low enough to hear the static), I determined that's really not a deal breaker for me, and it doesn't outweigh the pros.2. At first they were a little difficult to remove from the case, but I have quickly gotten better at knowing where to grab/how to remove.NEUTRAL FOR NOW/WILL UPDATE LATER:1. Call/mic quality? In my research I also came across a lot of complaints about call quality, people say that the other person on the line can barely hear them/there's a lot of noise, etc. For me, I literally didn't even consider this a factor in my decision making, because I barely care. It's not my primary purpose or use for my wireless earbuds. However, I'll eventually test it out and will update my review later with my experience.2. Touch controls. I'm new to this, so it could just be a learning curve, but every so often I have trouble getting the touch controls to respond or do exactly what I want. I like it, I think it's neat, and I'm sure I'll get better at it, but I also expect touch controls in general to be finicky on occasion.CONCLUSION:While I would recommend these to anyone, I do believe the best choice for everyone is going to be different, and that it's important to know what your priorities are, what annoys you more, etc.For me personally, the primary purpose of my earbuds is for enjoying music for relatively long periods of time, oftentimes while engaging in physical activity/chores, so sound/music quality and comfort are my two greatest priorities, so for my purposes, I am absolutely thrilled with these.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2022",AG64UIKDQLPDBRTDD2MI3NXXLV2A,True,256,Color: Soapstone
R1BC31YP5VEAIZ,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars Truly cancel out 100% of the noise,Wes,5,"These headphones are without a doubt the best headphones I have purchased so far in my entire life. I say thus far, because I know that technology is able to continue to become greater and greater as we advance through time, but as of 2023 these headphones are so packed with technology that they meet every need that I could want out of headphones, and additionally have some extra really cool perks.I want to talk first about the number one need that I wanted these headphones to meet. They claimed that they had 100% noise canceling and I can confirm that that is absolutely correct. Closing out the loud outside world is something that is real true need of mine. I live in a major city, and everything is so loud that I can barely concentrate. I can't go to the grocery store, out to eat, for a walk down the road, or sometimes even sit in my own home without having some sort of overpowering noise that I don't want to hear.So here's how these headphones work noise canceling-wise. I'll give you two scenarios.Scenario one, I have had a hard day and had to talk to people all day. I'm hungry, tired, don't want to talk to anyone or hear anyone's voices. I go to my favorite fish restaurant because I'm too tired to cook but I know that I'm going to need some peace and quiet when I get there. I place my food order, then sit down at my table in a very noisy environment with lots of peoples conversations going in the background. Relaxation is just about to begin. I take out my Bose headphones, I insert one into my ear, and then immediately I hear this sound that sounds like a lightsaber. That's the Microphones in the headphones testing the ear seal to make sure sound doesn't get into the headphones. I insert the second headphone into my other ear, and hear another lightsaber like sound. For about two more second I can still hear peoples voices and then all of the sudden I hear a ""beep"" and everyone's voices fade away! The noise cancelling has kicked in, and it's time for me to enjoy my dinner with some relaxing peaceful music. I'm now sitting in the middle of a restaurant and I can only hear my music and no one's voices at all. Sometimes I'll turn my music off in the middle of the restaurant, and I'll watch funny Instagram videos in the headphones. Usually after a 20 minute meal and some funny videos, I'm so relaxed and happy even after a hard day's work, that I'm ready to go home and go to sleep.Scenario two. I live next to a very busy major street. I can hear lots of road noise, exhaust, loud stereos, and many other kinds of noises. I like to take walks and relax. It's not very relaxing walking when I have to hear a lot of these noises. I insert my bose headphones , and all of the road noises fade away. All I can hear once again is my music. I have to make sure that I stay on the sidewalk when walking, because these headphones cancel out noise so well that if I try to walk on the road, I'll likely get hit by a car because I will not hear the cars driving near me.So that being said, the main thing I love about these is the noise canceling. I mentioned that there were couple cool extra things about these that I wanted to tell you about. I do like the amount of bass that these headphones are able to produce. It's way more than I expected. Additionally the clarity on these headphones is so good that I can can barely describe it in words. There is a treble mode, and a bass mode within the app so I can choose between these two modes and intensify the kind of clarity and or bass that I'd like.The charging case is a medium to small size. It fits well then my pants pocket and doesn't get in the way when I'm in the gym. That's one other thing that I wanted to make sure I told you about, is that these are the perfect headphones for the gym. I've seen several other people in the gym with them on, and now I know why. They don't move around in my ears at all! I work out very intensely, and if headphones were going to move around then they would move around on me. They stay exactly where I put them even though I'm sweating on them non-stop for over an hour each day.I love everything about these headphones. My only regret is that I let the price of these scare me away for so long, and I didn't order them soon enough.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2023",AF2A6IMIAJKTHBAN5QBBJB6WPP6A,True,268,Color: Soapstone

However, as time went on, I find that this new fit system just doesn’t work for me in my right ear. I’ve switched back-and-forth between all the sizes of the earplug and wing but overtime the right one just finds its way out of my ear and will literally fall out of my head. for an expensive pair of earbuds, This can be kind of annoying. No … very annoying. I really think Bose should’ve stuck with the previous fit system and improved upon it as opposed to going back to a more traditional wing system. The old system, while not perfect was very comfortable and never fell out of my head. So it’s truly unfortunate that this new model is better in someways and worse in others. Another issue is there is also synchronicity issues for the first few minutes after you put them on. The older model did not have this problem at all. I suspect this is because Bose caved under pressure to get independent channels to each ear and this causes some issues because this wasn’t happening until they updated the buds to support independent listening with either bud. As time goes by these are getting progressively worse and I should’ve just stuck with the previous model , which makes the previous model a great deal to buy. If you just want a really good pair of noise canceling earbuds, the noise canceling isn’t quite as good as this model but it’s more than adequate so I would say, save yourself some money and buy the previous model. I hope Bose goes back to the previous design and makes it a bit lighter and more compact instead of going with this new model wing system because it’s just not as good as the old one. It’s also more complicated and harder to get a good fit. Given the higher price and a step back on quality, I I am doing a pretty low score, but this is because the previous model is better and this one was more expensive so comparatively the previous mall gets five stars but this one gets three.P.S. Whoever’s idea it was to make the bottom of the case round so that you can never stand it on end? What? Considering that you have to leave the case open while checking status and setting up Bluetooth? It’s this kind of design decision that just begs the question, what were you thinking Bose?","Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2023",AFDPIRS4MY4CH5UTHCK72KKU6ALA,True,13,Color: Soapstone
RG5FCOUPWYR88,B0B4PSQHD5,2.0 out of 5 stars Physical product Nice sound/ noise cancelling. TERRIBLE software/ connection issues.,Kindle Customer,2,"Bought these back in February on sale for $250 after my Jaybirds (I had for nearly 5 years) finally bit the dust. As someone who uses earbuds daily for work, home, and gym; God knows how many hours I had on my Jaybirds listening to music, podcasts, and audio books. I actually felt sad when they broke and had huge expectations with these Bose. They're the first Bose I've ever had and I REALLY wanted to love these.The first month-ish they were great! Getting a new piece of tech years ahead of your previous, you really notice the sound quality, noise cancellation, batter life, and quick charge features. Unfortunately, that was were the good news stopped.Immediately, I noticed the right earbud is like the main unit. They won't operate independently while the right earbud is in the case which was a bummer not having that feature anymore, since I had this from a product years older, but not a dealbreaker for me.The BIGGEST problem is the connection issues. The software/ Bluetooth in these SUCK. You could have the greatest speakers and noise cancellation features in an earbud ever and it doesn't mean a damn thing if they don't actually connect/ work properly.I've had all manner of problems on this front from the earbuds not connecting in general, to the left/right speaker individually not connecting, or going-out/dropping randomly. Sometimes they'll be working just fine, until you pause whatever you're listening to and then you lose the sound/ connection and have to reset the Bluetooth connection/ put them back in the case and take them out again to get the sound back. There have been times when you place them in your ear and they register they're connected via the echo sound and voice saying so, only for you to wait 10-45 seconds for the sound to actually come through the speakers. I can go on-and-on about this forever, like every other month some new problem with the connection appears.I have a Galaxy S22 ultra so one of the newest/top end phones at the time as I believe the 23s were just about to roll out as I got these earbuds. Kept everything up to date, only device paired, have unpaired and cleared the cache then re-paired with the device, and every other trick Bose recommends on their website for troubleshooting the connection issues... It's still an ongoing issue that has been such a frustration.Another issue I've found was they never stayed in your ears very well. Moving your head suddenly or side-to-side can easily cause them to fall out. I switched the earpieces to the largest size that it comes with but still have problems now and again. I'm sure its a personal thing with the earpiece sizes and you could order 3rd party earpieces that fit better to solve this issue but with the connection issues being what they are, I never bothered investing more $ in a defective product.This leads me to my last issue though, due to previous issues, I never used these earbuds for the gym/ working out/ running. So you'd think that would cut a lot of wear and tear down on the product. Yet, come October here and the hinge on the top cover of the case gave out and broke off. Luckily the magnets on the earbuds are strong enough to keep them in place in the case to not fall out while in your pocket. But that was it, roughly 8 months of ownership and the case already gave out which caused me to come back and write this review.When they work, they work great, but unfortunately that was short-lived in my case. If you wana roll the dice good luck!Personally, its been such a let down and pain that I will never buy another pair of Bose again after this.","Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2023",AFQGMDQY5LOBQ3NNHNWVBZWW6BBA,True,38,Color: Triple Black
R183MPT8IUPDQJ,B0B4PSQHD5,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Noise Cancellation With Minor Connectivity Issues,Luis A. Almaguer,4,"I hate to give these earbuds only four stars because they do have incredible sound and offer amazing noise cancellation, but they do have some small shortcomings. On the positive side, they are super comfortable. Also, the sound on these earbuds is so good that I once had to pause a movie that I was watching because I thought there was someone else in the room, only to realize that I was actually hearing the background conversation from two other characters in the movie 😂. Similarly, I use them for work, and I have had coworkers tap me on the shoulder because they had been talking to me and I had not noticed at all.On the negative side, for some reason, I keep experiencing connectivity issues. To be fair, these issues are more of an annoyance than a serious problem--in my opinion--and very easily corrected. The ""biggest"" issue in this sense is that whenever I switch from one of my devices to another the new device sometimes does not recognize the earbuds, and I have to reset them to go through the entire paring process again. The problem only occurs about 20% of the time, but it is still quite annoying--especially when I'm about to go for a run and I have to spend several minutes fixing it. All in all, though, I would still choose these earbuds over all the other brands I've used, including both Apple's and Samsung's earbuds. Oh, and did I mention how awesome the sound is 😆...","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AGQZOKGAVE472Y47FUZ6AK5TFZNA,True,1,Color: Triple Black

Turning noise cancellation off and on works fairly well, but turning sound off and on is not very consistent. And using the ear buds for volume control does not seem to work for me, even though the owner's guide states it is a control option. However, cannot find any actual instructions on setting up noise control. Although the ear buds fit well, I find myself trying not to adjust them in my ears for fear of the controls taking over when I just want to push the ear bud in slightly. Also, the two ear buds occasionally lose sync. Finally, I use them with both my iPhone and iPad, and I have to almost always go to the blue tooth setup to turn one device off and the other device on manually. My older Bose ear buds that were wired NEVER had a problem with syncing or which device I wanted (obviously).","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2024",AETDNLSZ44EMHP5KAGKLPBIURNIA,True,0,Color: Triple Black

R1CZOXBYV4UMN8,B0B4PSQHD5,2.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as original Quiet Comfort Earbuds,Kindle Customer,2,"First the positives!1. The earbuds are smaller2. They're lighter3. The case is smaller and lighter and easier to fit into a pocket. (love this actually)and thats about it.I'm going to discuss the default settings for these QCII earbuds - and there's a reason that I'll get to later in this review.The negatives1. They don't fit as well as their predecessors. The ear canal piece and the outer ring just don't fit the same and are not nearly as comfortable - though they are lighter - they hurt my ears within minutes (yes I tried the different sizes)2. They don't seal as well as the original Quiet Comfort earbuds. Period.3. The sound has too much bass (bass makes everything sound more awesome-r right?!) - the default sound equalization is just not as good when compared to the original Bose QC earbuds. I would need to have a separate software eq now, which I am not going to do.4. The default noise cancelling is not as good as the originals (imo). There are only 2 default settings for ANC now, instead of the original version which had 3 - high, mid, low ANC. Bose thought that extra default settings for the QCII weren't necessary. This is probably a way to ""encourage"" users to sign up and create an account using a mobile device - which I can't do anyway because I have a MacBook!5. THE WORST - and a word of warning for MacOS users - There is NO, zero, zip, zilch, nada, Apple Store APP to set these up! The app is only for Google or iPhones! There is no way to get the functionality from these that you need, without an iPhone or an Android phone running the Bose app!To be fair I can take some responsibility by not doing sufficient research about how to control the new QCII earbuds. I believe that Bose hobbled the default functions intentionally, especially when compared to the original QC earbuds, to force users and data collection through their iOS and Android app. I will probably just deal with it. I don't want to return them but they're not the old original QC earbuds, and they are just not as good, so they'll prob go to someone else.I really was looking forward to getting an updated/upgraded set of earbuds and these sure let me down. I might end up returning them now that I keep mulling on it. I'm just not happy at all with these things. I'll try and make an update in a week or so of use to see if my opinion changes, but with the hobbled functionality I'm not going to hold my breath.edit and update:I tried and tried to like these, but the user interface is so horrible, and the lack of functionality with Windows and MacOS is a deal breaker. (confirmed by Bose customer support)I have no way to control these, and the user interface, in regards to tapping the ear pieces to perform an action, is really really bad. The old version would accept a double tap to change the ANC settings and it worked very quickly. The new version takes probably 10 seconds to get the earbuds to a state where I could hear a conversation with a person, and that's just not acceptable.I will be returning these. 2 stars because they are much lighter, and the smaller case - but no wireless charging and the terrible user interface (touch tapping and touch holding on the ear pieces) combined with no way to adjust the earbuds settings without an android device or an iPhone is just a hard no. Can't do it.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHZYEKPEDIN5BGAP5SHVFOCWCY3A,True,0,Color: Triple Black

R8P8WII8HBQI0,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars These are the best headphones on the market 4/23,Maximus Joseppi,3,"Edit: They have finally glitched out and died on me. I do stand by that these are the best ear buds as far as hardware is concerned but their software is bad-borderline terrible. After 11 months they just wouldn't connect anymore but Bose did honor their warranty and even send me ultras as a nice gesture.. but they had so many connectivity issues throughout my year with them, very often having to do a hard reset to clear whatever glitch was going on. They also don't have an ANC off mode??? There's no excuse for it and it makes these earbuds totally useless in windy conditions, on a boat, car with the windows down, bike, motorcycle etc... bose.... Take 10 minutes to add an off setting to these buds in the software. There's already code for it since they turn off when you put them in the case or take them out of your ear... Let us turn them off. Worst feature and they didn't change it for the ultrasAs of April 2023, these are by far the best ear buds on the planet. I live in my ear buds.. every day, almost all day I have them in watching videos and streams and some music so I always splurge on what the reviews say are the best. I had the Sony XM4s for 13 months and I used them every day until their battery very quickly went from lasting 6 hours to 4 to literally 1 hour. Their warranty is 12 months and at 12 months and 1 day, they won't honor it. Had to throw them away after 13 months.I was extremely impressed with those so I was actually shocked when I first put these QC 2s in my ears...-The noise cancelling is revolutionary. Like, actually a game changer. I have $1200 noise cancelling aviation headsets and they don't come close to these never mind the XM4s. It makes every other noise cancelling I've experienced seem like a gimmick toy by comparison, it's actually a strange sensation is so amazing.-the sound isn't even comparable to anything else. These are night and day way better than the XM4s and every other ear buds I've ever heard. The base actually sounds like a crisp powerful sub woofer with in depth deep powerful notes when listening to explosions or music. It's just a powerful and full sound without any lacking areas.-they are extremely comfortable, so were the XM4s. It's kind of a wash here because I could have both in my ears for 10 hours and be happy and I probably readjust them just as often as any other bud at the gym.-they look cool, better than the girlie XM4s that had that rose gold jewelry look that I had to sand down and paint black. These are masculine and nice right from Bose. On the bigger side but couldn't care less for the noise cancelling and auditory performance.-the app and controls kinda suck, not going to lie. Had some connectivity issues with the app and had to reset the buds for it to connect to them. You need the app to connect to them change any settings.. I find it annoying that you can't turn the controls off or customize any of the touch shortcuts. I had much cheaper buds with completely customizable touch controls and the app would let you turn off all or any singular touch control you don't want for any situation. Bose, epic hardware, just hire one good software guy too.-the only actual problem and complaint I have with these are you can't turn off the noise cancelling or noise enhancing feature entirely. If you are on a motorcycle or in heavy wind, noise cancelling buds give loud feedback and the XM4s allowed you to turn that off but still get audio, these are always on.Again, epic hardware, hire a software guy.Overall, nothing even comes close to these ear buds regardless of the mediocre software attached to them that you will almost never use after initial setup. That being said, they should solve that issue cause it's not very hard to do and for $300 and the best hardware on the market, a good fully customizable software program to go with them would really seal the deal and complete the package.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2023",AG7JPX7SAUTMR6GE2GQMDJX74KLA,True,235,Color: Triple Black
R2VBQEAXSON0WD,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars One of the flimsiest feeling cases and some of the least consistent software,Josh rizzolo,3,"I want to like these headphones. I love their sound quality, noise cancelling, ear fit, and touch controls. All great. The touch controls specifically stand out against things like the Galaxy buds+ which I owned last. Touches on the ear are registered well, as are the small ""gestures"" to change volume (Swipe up and down on the ear).That being said, two things that define the true-wireless headphone experience more than anything else for me are the case and the user experience. Firstly, the case is fully plastic with a very light lid. Build quality just feels distinctly low for the price point here. It doesn't seem like it always forces the headhphones down into the charging position, as sometimes they stay connected to my phone when in the case, despite full case battery. The case isn't horrible, but it stands out as disappointing against more reasonably priced earbuds from years ago (again, the first Galaxybuds+). I won't complain about case battery life or ease of use though. It is simple to activate pairing mode with the case, and I don't run out of battery in it like I did with my old earbuds.The user experience is really the thing I have the most gripe with. By user experience, I specifically mean the seamlessness with which the headphones connect and sync with the phone when a connection is started. For the most part, it's not bad. Taking both earbuds out of the case and putting them in your ears at once works well most of the time. However, I have had consistent issues using the left earbud by itself. These issues are unique to the left (at least for my pair) with the right functioning almost as expected on its own. The times I do have connection issues with both buds, however, they are more persistent than with any other pair of headphones I have yet owned. Sometimes I put them in my ears and they connect, but I hear nothing no matter what I do. In the end, the only way I have consistently fixed this is to unpair them from my phone and restart my phone. Only then can I try to repair. I have not found another sequence that works, despite multiple resets, unpairs, trying one earbud or the other, checking my volume, etc. It's truly annoying to have to deal with this at this price. Thankfully, this could be a software issue, and thus could be patched. Fingers crossed.In the same vein, the app needs some large updates. While it mostly works well, the devil is in the details. No matter what I do, the headphones don't actually seem to remember the mode they were last in when I put them back in my ears. Ok, not horrible. Can't change the default mode of the single earbud either as far as I have found. Still not horrible but getting annoying. The worst part, however, is that the app will read that the earbuds are in a mode they are not in very often on startup. Seems like the app doesn't read the mode from headphones on start. This means, if you want to change the mode to noise cancelling for one earbud in the app you must change the mode from quiet (default on the app despite not being the default for single earbud) to aware, and back to quiet to get the noise cancelling. You can also change modes via the touch functions on the earbud, which doesn't require this annoying switch and switch back behavior.No dealbreakers here. Overall good headphones with good sound, noise cancelling, and battery. But, competing at the $250+ price point, the build quality of the case and the software polish are disappointing. Were I to go back, I'd try a different new pair of earbuds, likely from Sony as I like their overear and their earbud cases.","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2024",AFDZWOVHPLFWH6ONZK2DW7WHBYAA,True,2,Color: Triple Black

This is a great device, but it's kind of ruined by the fact that the software is so poorly implemented. Usually when I read reviews that talk about connectivity issues or software problems, I just assume it's user error and that the problem wouldn't ever happen to me. That is not the case here. The software is genuinely bad. There genuinely are connectivity issues. Not so much the headphones have a hard time pairing with my phone (yet), but rather simply that the app can only access the settings for the headphones, or even find the headphones, about 20% of the time.In a lot of use cases that doesn't really matter. This is a new toy, however, and I kind of want to play with the settings. You know, it would be nice to know exactly what this thing can and can't do. Can't figure that out if I can't access it in the app.I'm thinking about returning. Honestly, I don't want to because the hardware is so very good. The noise cancellation is truly superb. Reference point for me would be the pixel buds pro and Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2. Also pixel buds hey series, but those don't have ANC, so as a reference point... I'm not really sure how it serves.Anyway, I think I might have no choice but to return if the software update (which is really hard to apply without being able to access settings in the app) doesn't fix the problems and having, which incidentally have everything to do with...

I already have the Sony WF-SP800N earbuds, but the Bose are better in both categories! But where I like the Sony better than Bose is, the sony buds will auto connect to the last device I was connected to, and the Bose only seem to auto connect to my phone but only if it were the last thing I was connected to before putting them back in charging case. Idk if I’m doing something wrong, but I don’t think so.THE BAD: with the Bose is a few times the left bit would not play anything at all. I’d reset it over and over again with no luck! Then it would work fine the next day. Actually, I don’t even currently have the Bose earbuds possession bc the left earbud all of a sudden started blasting static and then a very loud crackling noise started happening that made me tense up and jerk the earbud out of my ear bc it hurt my ear pretty bad. The crackling wasn’t constant, but it happened every couple seconds and even with volume turned down it was loud! And this pretty much made the left Bud useless. I don’t think anything but the static and cracks sound was coming out of it.The GOOD NEWS - Bose seems to have a pretty good customer service/warranty bc I did a few clicks on their website explaining issue and they’re replacing these QC 2s with Pair of the ULTRAS!! So while it sux to have to go without the buds after paying that price for them at least I’m getting an upgrade and I still have the Sony’s to hold me over. The Sony’s are bulky, but I actually still really like them and these 800s (I don’t think they make them anymore) NEVER fall out of my ear!

R37FAQRSJF2RYW,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars The first ANC earbuds that actually are noise-cancelling when you need it,theleeshow,5,"Browsing my order history going back to 2015 I've had 4 pairs of cheap wired earbuds.My favorite headphones are the Sony over ear WH-1000XM4. I tried the WH-1000XM5's and still liked the older model better. The Sony's spoiled me for their noise-cancelling ability. I fly for work almost every week. When I got this job the first thing I did was research headphones and picked up the 1000XM2's and loved them.I've been hunting for a pair of wireless noise-canceling earbuds for a few years. I tried Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus, Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Pro, and now these Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.I wasn't expecting much from the Samsungs and they lived up to my expectations. I returned them. The Sennheisers were the greatest sounding earbuds I have ever heard, but they were uncomfortable and the noise cancelling was poor. The Sony earbuds were also poor at noise cancelling and didn't sound that great to my ears, especially compared to the over the ear models I love. They were also finicky and uncomfortable.I never seriously considered the Bose options in the headphones / earbuds game. ""No highs, no lows, must be Bose."" The Bose sound has always been my least favorite. Clear, midrange, just baffling why people like it. Maybe my ears are damaged, but just not for me. Then I read a review. I took the plunge. No kidding - the noise cancelling on these is as good as the Sony over the ear models.My test for noise cancelling is taking the earbuds for a walk. I do a few miles around the neighborhood every day - and after the Sony's entered my life, the 'clomp clomp clomp' of my footsteps with any other earbud/headphone has driven me crazy. I put these on last night and played a few tracks on TIDAL Master quality - Beatles, Prince, some classical, and there it was. That midrange Bose sound that drives me batty. I switched between these and the Sony's - and the Sony's sound great with no tweaking. They just sound great. I have fallen in love with pipe organ recordings because of the Sony's I think. I love the way the recordings sound and feel in the Sony's. No way these Bose are going to cross this hurdle of sounding like Bose. It's just what they are, not my taste.This morning I tweaked the EQ on my phone to make the Bose less Bose-sounding, and started on my walk, and I couldn't hear my footsteps. I COULDN'T HEAR MY 'CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP.' Oh my goodness. Why do these have to be Bose! These things are a miracle. A MIRACLE. So I dug into my phone's sound settings a little more and saw they have different sound settings for people, depending on their age. I clicked on my age (none of your business!) and the Bose sounded better. More in line with what I'm used to. I played a pipe organ piece and it didn't sound as full as the Sony's but it was fine. It passed my test.I have read the Bose doesn't use the fancy high quality codecs the Sony's use. I could hear sound degradation on quieter passages of a classical recording - but I looked at the recording and it was on a not top-tier label, so maybe it was just an average recording. But the bottom line is- after returning several pair of earbuds for the reasons spelled out above, I am actually going to keep these.I discovered the Bose app has it's own EQ which tweaks the sound a little better than my phone's.

I'm here to tell you, in June 2024, you absolutely can. Also the battery life is amazing since the case recharges everytime you put the buds away. I honestly haven't used them for calls yet, but I didn't buy them for that reason, only for music and podcasts.I was torn between buying these and the new ultra open Bose earbuds, but I'm pretty happy with these and the noise cancellation.

There’s been plenty of times that i’ll pop the right earbud in my ear and it fails to connect. I have to then troubleshoot by closing apps that i’m trying to listen content from, putting earbud(s) back into the case and back out. Opening up the Bose app and trying to connect through that. And sometimes i’ll have to remove the device off of my bluetooth list and do the reconnecting all over again. And even then it might not connect. so you’re just trying to get it to connect to your device over a period of time. Quite annoying. Also, if you enter an area where it’s really loud , around 120+ decibels or so, and have the noise reduction to max, you’ll start to hear pinging coming from them so i don’t recommend them in really loud environments.","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024",AEOI32CIRD7DQKDGQQRMKXCVED7Q,True,0,Color: Triple Black

R53FMVL6HJIEG,B0B4PSQHD5,2.0 out of 5 stars EDITED BECAUSE OF MANUFACTURER WARRANTY Very disappointed for the first time with a Bose product,Jordan Bowen,2,"My original review of this product wasn’t great to say the least but I do want to add this info as I just completed my warranty claim with Bose on these earbuds and I’m very happy with the outcome. My original review is still available below and although I do still have the same feelings for this exact product, the problem was rectified by the manufacturer. I contacted Bose with the issue I was having and was emailed a shipping label to return the earbuds and was offered their newest model (Quiet Comfort Ultra) as a replacement. Within 7 business days of me sending my earbuds in to Bose I have received the new product which came brand new in the original packaging and for this I’m beyond grateful. I decided to leave my original two star rating however because it pertains to the original earbuds that were a nightmare. If I were to review the new model they had sent as a replacement it would be 5 stars though!Original Review (before warranty replacement)Let me start by saying that I am a huge Bose fan and would consider myself very loyal to the brand. The very first product I purchased was the 3-2-1 home entertainment system probably around 17 years or so ago and since then if it has anything to do with speakers for me, it is most definitely a Bose product. This even includes my vehicle which I am thrilled that Cadillac always have Bose speakers installed. As for earbud headphones, I started with the Bose SoundSport model and they were great. Unfortunately, after almost a year and a half of heavy use the batteries were shot and only lasted about 30 minutes on a full charge so I upgraded to the Quiet Comfort model which I also loved. Unfortunately, after owning those for a year the glue that held them together began to break down and one of them separated into two pieces and would no longer play sound. For the amount I use these, I don't think that them only lasting a year was that bad. I basically wear them for at the least an hour every single day and most days 4+ hours. It was after the Quiet Comforts fell apart that I purchased these Quiet Comfort II series earbuds and the first thing I noticed was that there didn't seem to be much of an upgrade in sound quality or at least it wasn't as noticeable as the upgrade from the SoundSports to the first Quiet Comfort model. After a few days of using them they began to constantly lose connection to my iPhone & iPad and most of the time when this happens, a simple reset won't fix the issue and they refuse to connect to any of my devices. Ive tried everything to correct this when it happens, forget them in my phone's settings, erase them from my Bose Music app, etc. Nothing corrects it other than time. After a few hours of being in their case they will connect again after being removed but this is happening more frequent than not and it is extremely annoying. They also very recently started doing this thing where the sound gets all distorted while using them and then it will start playing sound from only one side for a few seconds and then it will switch to the other side and back continuously for a minute or so. It just really shocks me that I had absolutely zero complaints on any of my previous Bose earbud models and here I am having a nightmare of a time with these Quiet Comfort IIs. I did notice there is a new series/model out now(Quiet Comfort Ultra) and I really wish my Quiet Comfort 1s lasted just another two months or so as I would've just purchased whatever the newest model was at that time but to now spend another $300.00 +/- after just spending $275.00 on these only four months ago is very upsetting as well as the thought that the new model might also not be the same tremendous quality that I believed my previous Bose ear buds were. To tie up this review, I can't say enough good things about Bose products, however I would personally stay away from this model as they've been nothing but issues for me since the very first few times that I used them.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2024",AFUYAUYXNK257JQFNFKKMMXVXP6A,True,5,Color: Eclipse Grey
RRYLC0AQ4BQJE,B0B4PSQHD5,4.0 out of 5 stars Best sound quality but……,Zay rodriguez,4,"I’ll start with how amazing the sound quality is out of these earbuds, best wireless earbud sound quality I’ve heard, I compared to AirPods gen 1. AirPods Pro gen 1 and 2. But for $300 when comparing to AirPods Pro 2, AirPods takes it. I wear earbuds all day for 4-6 hours at a time, I’m a automotive technician so I would use the noise cancellation features quite a bit. I do love that the noise cancellation is adjustable, and both the AirPods Pro 2 and Bose quitecomfort 2 have a adaptive transparency mode that allows all noise in but protects from noises above 90 decibels, which in the automotive industry is pretty much every air tool we use. When Bose activates this feature it sounds robotic and changes your listening audio, makes it sound odd for a second or two, apple is much smoother when their adaptive transparency works. Also many more features with the apple earbuds, from 3 charging methods and find my features, Bose only has one which is cable charging. AirPods can completely turn off transparency or noise cancellation, Bose cannot. My biggest reason for ultimately choosing AirPods pro2 was the comfort, the Bose earbuds began to chaff my ears after about 1.5 hours, the AirPods I can go for 5+ before I notice any discomfort. So side by side with features the apple AirPods will win this hands down, but… if you’re an audiophile, the sound quality you get from Bose is unbeatable and apple doesn’t come close, also the adjustability of degree of noise cancellation is a fantastic Bose feature, but other than that, the AirPods won me out, mainly due to their integration into iOS UI. I’m sure if I had a android I would stick with the Bose option but apple made sure the AirPods work flawlessly with their iOS devices. Last thing I will mention, maybe it was just my set, but they were a bit buggy. What happened was, in 5 days of owning, they connected 6 times but played no audio, I had to set them back in their case and start over for that to remedy, also for the first 15 seconds after you put them in, the tap controls are very buggy, either severely delayed response or nos response, once they’ve been in Your ears for over a minute they work perfect. Last annoyance was using tap controls, when using it’s almost like an even slight tap on the earbuds is amplified and is obnoxiously loud, I thought maybe I was tapping too hard, but with AirPods gen 1, which are all tap controlled, the action of tapping on the side produces no real noise. I’m telling you, the tap on the side sounds like a balloon popping at a distance of 15-20 ft away every time, it was very difficult to overlook that during my use. You literally have to delicately tap the side to have no audio discomfort, with AirPods I will literally tap with my buckles if my hands are dirty and I get no audible discomfort, no shockingly loud tap, so I don’t know if it is physically transferring the noise in or the noise transparency is interpreting the tapping as a noise and just amplifying this for your ears, either way it’s highly annoying and was the ultimate deal breaker for me.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2022",AFZDLR4QANPSZ6DPCD7VDABOL65Q,True,152,Color: Triple Black

Unfortunately, I was disappointed to discover that they are very difficult to fit into my ears in such a way that they will reliably stay put while exercising or walking. They require a ""twist"" to sort of lock into place, and none of the provided inserts seem to work for my ears. Any jostling, especially if you're at all sweaty, will cause them to work loose and fall out. What's more, they rely on a tight ""seal"" in the ear for the noise cancelling to really work, and that can be very hard to achieve. After buying them, I located my old ones, so I've had a chance to compare them side-by-side by going back and forth, and I honestly prefer my old ones to these. These do have slightly better sound quality, and perhaps better battery life, but honestly what does that matter if they don't stay put? I still use them on the airplane, where they aren't likely to fall out, but I don't bother using them while exercising.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2024",AH656IEJOIEA44JAFIPQUOSD776Q,True,1,Color: Triple Black

I was genuinely surprised about the sound quality and immediate bass that hits you right off the bat, and that's without the bose app EQ. Speaking of the app, the app is complete garbage. It did not identify the headphones at all to pair with my phone and it wasn't until the last second of giving up that it finally paired. Honestly after using the EQ settings to keep them at my preferred sound I deleted the app immediately. The microphone quality is super questionable as well. Whenever you're in a call it'll pick up every single sound around you no matter how loud and it'll transfer it to the receiving end of the person you're in a call with, making it very hard to deal with and them not being able to hear any word you say. It also drops bluetooth pairing pretty frequently which made me think it was the pair of headphones I had received. But it wasn't, it's this model in general, I have the same issue even with the new pair. Be careful being around very loud sudden noises too, the mic will try to dim the audio but in return it'll basically pop your ear drum in the process. Overall I do kinda regret buying these headphones although sound quality and build quality is exceptional. I feel like there are way better headphones out there with no issues at all at the same price point that don't use a garbage app.","Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2024",AFSM26I4HZGW2UNMR5UJUL5QVB7Q,True,3,Color: Triple Black

R4LWGICS5DGTT,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars Works Wonderfully Until It Doesn't,Amazon Customer,3,"I really liked these earbuds for about 3 months, liked them modestly for 2 months, tolerated them for 2 more months and then had to send them back when they stopped working today. When they work, which is irregularly, they are the best noise cancelling earbuds I've used bar none and I've used pretty much everything made by Sony, Samsung and Bowers & Wilkins. They are a bit bass heavy but that can be equalized out when listening to music. The major problems are three different connection issues and then eventually the death of the right ear bud. First, they don't sit well in the case which meant I had to adjust the stabilizer band and often tap the right ear bud to make sure it was seated. If not, you will lose the ability to connect to anything as everything connects through the right ear bud. Second, I would lose the left earbud sound at least 3x per week mostly when going from WiFi to cellular coverage. That would be fixed by putting the earbuds in the case for 10 seconds and then putting them back on. However, even that would occasionally lead to loss of the left earbud multiple times on a 15 minute walk. If I charged them for more than 2 hours, I would also often lose the left ear bud connection.About once every 1-2 weeks, I'd have to hard reset these, which meant that I would have delete the QC Earbuds ii from the app and the phone and then charge the case and hold the connection button for 25 seconds while doing so. The issue here is that if you don't have a USBc cable with you that you can use to charge the case, this won't work. You would then re-pair the device through the app and to the phone and then it would work. However, the last time I did that today, it would no longer connect to anything as the right ear bud won't recognize the contact in the case.Finally, the app is garbage. About 20% of the time even when working to play music the app didn't recognize the earbuds. I have a bunch of Bose products that have lasted forever. This one is really disappointing, which is made worse by the fact that it is really a wonderful device when it works.Update: I sent them back and received a new set of earbuds that for the past month have worked fine. For these, I've taken three different new approaches. I don't use them with any other device except my cellular phone. I found that they would often drop the connection if I had another device paired to the earbuds that was on. I don't do that any longer. I purchased a case to put the case in as I've found that dropping the case causes the earbuds to lose their ability to sit in the case which makes these no longer functional. Finally, I'm very careful when handling these buds as they don't tolerate being dropped. With this approach so far so good so I'm upping my rating to three stars for now.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2023",AE3HC6ISD5SQKWVADKKALOSAHMNA,True,49,Color: Soapstone

When I was trying to fit these, they fell on the floor twice and were scratched both times. My Sound sports have been dropped many times in 4yrs and still look brand new.I actually prefer the in-ear design on the sound Sport buds, so much. Even though they look bulky in the ear, they never fell out and stayed in very well. I think going smaller on the buds was a huge down fall for people with smaller ears.

They would not enter pairing mode no matter how long I held the button down. Tried all of the troubleshooting steps on the support page, plus a few YouTube page recommendations; no luck. The charge indicator inside the case would only light up if I held the buds down. Returning to Amazon for an exchange. May revise my review after I see how the 2nd pair performs.

I finally decided it down to these and Beats Fit Pro. I really like these and honestly between the two you really can't tell much difference. The noise cancelation is a tiny bit better in the Bose, but the sound and bass response is better in the Beats. It honestly came down to one deciding factor, the button to change songs and control the ear buds. On the Beats you actually have a bottom you can feel that clicks instead of the Bose where you just touch the outside. Obviously with the Beats, it's very responsive with the button feel, the Bose were actually more difficult to control. Sometimes when you pressed it twice to change the song it would put it on pause, and pressing it three times would only change the song to the next track instead of repeating or taking you back a track. The Beats seem to fit a bit better than the Bose as well. Also, the Beats were $50 cheaper, honestly not a deal breaker either way, but it was added to the pros when I started adding everything up against the two. Overall my choice after about a week of comparing the two were the Beats. I actually really wanted to like the Bose more, because I have grown up with Bose and always had their products, but at the end of the day Beats came out on top.

RTWA2E2SLE1RK,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars Perfect - Until You Update to Latest Firmware,Paul T.,3,"I have always been a fan of the original Bose QuietComfort Earbuds which I have enjoyed for a few years. When I temporarily misplaced them I decided to pull the trigger on the new Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II. When I first got them I was stunned! The sound quality was amazing, surpassing the already incredible first generation. The resolution was so good I was picking up nuances of sound never heard before in songs I had listened to for many years. The noise cancelling was even better than the first generation. The bass left me wondering how there could be so much impact happening inside my ear. Sound quality was 6 out of 5 stars.But then I noticed a firmware update in the Bose app. I foolishly thought that what was perfect could become even better. Wow, was I wrong. Shortly after the update, I noticed some random anomalies. For a split second, the sound would warp, almost as if the sync between the two buds skewed between stereo and mono. At first I thought it was just a random glitch in the source material but this proved not to be the case. The issue became more frequent and proved consistent on other devices with multiple sources. I officially had a defective product.Bose support was quick to exchange the earbuds for a new pair. They sent me a shipping label and were quick to ship on their end once they received my old set. I did not realize at the time that the new firmware was the issue. So when I got the new pair, guess what I did? Yep, updated the firmware right out of the box. Predictably, the same issue occurred with the new set. At this point I did what I should have the first time around and researched the issue online. It did not take long to find that many others were having the same problem since the update.The second call to Bose went similar to the first with a quick resolution to replace the headphones. I am now waiting for the new ones and hope they have an older firmware version on them. Unfortunately the Bose rep was not able to do anything but follow their script and had no information about if they were working on a fix for the firmware. i'm sure this is a known issue and hope that they address it soon.If Bose fixes their glitchy firmware then I will update this review and the buds will score a solid 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",AEH2PBBYBNXC3VPPQAVR5LGXCNCA,True,5,Color: Triple Black

Those had great noise canceling for the time and good sound but most important the quality was there. Next i purchased the 1st gen wired earbuds. Those had better noise canceling and sound but i had to replace them under warranty because there was a problem with wires shorting out. Next i got the bose quietcomfort wireless noise canceling earbuds. Noise canceling was much improved as was sound quality. With those, that by the way i still have, never a single problem whatsoever. Quality took a turn for the better. Consequently i had similar expectations for these the quietcomfort earbuds II.The design was smaller as was the case. The latter was an improvement, much easier to open. Once i got the tips and sealer pieces in place i immediately noticed how much the sound had improved over the previous gen quietcomfort buds. Even better somehow they improved noise cancelation a great deal. Sounds, frequencies the others weren't able to do a good job blocking these did effortlessly. As to comfort they are still good in that respect but not so much as the previous gen buds. Then we get to the battery and charging.The newest iteration of buds when fully charged and with noise canceling active approximately an hour longer than the earlier version of wireless buds. That's where the good ends and a very serious flaw comes into play. More often than i go to use from what's supposed to be a fully charged case to hear them say not 100% but somewhere between 30-60%. Even with the case left plugged in with the buds inserted, it makes no difference. Then related they frequently won't disconnect from my devices unbeknownst to me based on outward appearances.So yet again bose quality takes the downward path. I want to love these earbuds but if they don't charge reliably what's the point of having them to begin with? I've searched online and found many customers experiencing the exact same issues. The few possible solutions didn't fix things at my end or the majority of those who posted online in help forums, reddit etc.All said i would not buy these again and have been disappointed too many times to remain a loyal bose customer.

The only negative is that the case they are in is slippery. It keep slipping out of my hands, and when the case hits the floor, the top opens and the buds spill out.A textured case and a stronger spring on the flip cap. Otherwise very nice. I wear mine on the plane, mowing the lawn, and splitting wood with the splitter. It knocks the noise down substantially. Even blocks annoying conversations in a crowded room. Not bulky.Six month update:Still sound great. The little rubber band that surrounds the ear bud to make it easier to get out of the case easily falls off and gets lost.The buds need to be reseated in your ear every so often or they fall out, resulting in having to chase it across the floorMost annoying is they don’t seat very well in the charging case all the time. This results in staying connected to your phone and all calls going to it. It also discharges the earbuds so they are dead when you need them.Battery life is good. I wear them an hour every morning at the gym, and when doing other stuff aside from calls.Next time I’ll get ones that loop over the ear so I don’t have to run after them when they fall out.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AHZHF4RU6YWJORWRM3O23IVYRVKQ,True,1,Color: Triple Black
R1JHGGT65KC0DL,B0B4PSQHD5,"3.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED: First pair arrived broken, second pair was better but still returned them…",Amazin' Customer,3,Currently have Bose Sounds Sports and theyre the best earbuds bar non but quite bulky and heavy so was excited to try them. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. The bass is completely distorted and the mids and highs are horrible. Had to send them back and just ended up keeping my Sound sports.UPDATE: So I thought it was strange how distorted the bass was on my first pair so I decided to try again. I was right! It appears the first pair was sent damaged and the sound was night and day without any distortion. Below I will list the Pros and Cons as to why I still decided to return the second pair.Pros:- Incredible sound. You pick up sounds and quality in songs you've never even noticed before. Whole new experience.- Touch controls are seamless and make it very easy for controlling.- Noice cancellation is the best Ive experienced for any earbuds I have ever tried.- Snug fit so if you want to use for running or sports.Cons:- Not as compatible with apple products as traditional airpods. You have to use physical controls to activate Siri and noise cancellation. Cant be done by voice.- Starts to hurt ears after 30+ minutes of use due to how snug they fit. Earhooks on bose soundsports are much better.- Bigger charging case than most earbuds that dont show battery life without having to access app and no wireless charging. Must use USB-C for charging.- You can only create one shortcut per earbud with long press.-Noise cancellation is only to block out sounds you can hear but does not cancel out background noises to listeners for phone calls. They can hear all background noises if you're in a loud office or environment.,"Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2024",AGPUP57FOBX4JDQ37MGYEBK56MEQ,True,1,Color: Triple Black
R21NMJKHZJR8AH,B0B4PSQHD5,"3.0 out of 5 stars They were okay, but not outstanding.",Kindle Customer,3,"I really really wanted to like these earbuds. I was upgrading from a less expensive noise-canceling pair because the noise-canceling on those was okay but not amazing. I tried to do my research because these aren't cheap, and I am a fan of Bose products.The pros: the sound on these was really good, and so was the noise-canceling. I liked that I could customize the controls for each earbud, to a point, and I liked how well it drowned out ambient noise when I activated the noise canceling. Even when I didn't have music playing, they would still muffle the sounds around me. The touch controls did take a minute to get used to, but it was nice to be able to control the volume from the earbuds, which is something I couldn't do on my old pair.Now the negatives.The connection problems that everyone talks about are valid. I only used these with my phone, and after a week they started to get weird with connecting to it. I tested the connection with one earbud, both earbuds and the problem seemed to be if I was consistently taking one in and out of the case. It's worth noting that the range on these if I walked away without my phone, was not very far.Another complaint I saw in the comments was the voice assistant that talks to you. I personally didn't have a problem because if you have any other product in the Bose family, namely the speakers, it's exactly the same with announcing the battery life and when you're connecting to a phone. The voice also doesn't come in too loud so that was not a concern for me.At the end of the day, the reason I returned them was because the earbuds were painful for me to wear. I tried every combination imaginable with the given interchangeable parts. None of them solved the problem and it just hurt too much to wear them for any extended period of time (an hour was about my limit). I do have small ears, so this is probably where the problem came from, but I tried the earbuds without the pieces that cover where the sound comes out (not sure what else to call it) and they were still too long.I get why they are priced so high, I do. I'm just disappointed that I spent that much money on something that ultimately didn't work. Definitely should've done more research on their comfort.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023",AGBWPEUHYHJJEESSRTCYKLHB2RQA,True,4,Color: Soapstone

R2P6U1KYIBGY18,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Earbuds I Have Ever Found,Nate,5,"Let me tell you the saga of my earbud journey.I have very small ears and have never found a pair of earbuds that fits comfortably, stays in, and doesn't cause me any pain. I had a pair of UE fits, because those buds were the only ones I've found that were mildly comfortable (but they still fell out and felt too large) so when UE came out with their custom built ""Drops"" earbuds, I ecstatically tried them. To my great disappointment, they could not size my ears and told me that their custom buds would never work for me.That made me give up all hope that I would be able to find comfortable earbuds, but I was determined to find some that at least didn't fall out like my UE fits, and were higher quality (since the UE fits feel sort of flimsy and cheap, really) and after much research I decided to try these, but my expectations were low. I did not expect them to work.Boy, have I never been so wrong in my life! These are amazing!!! They are extremely comfortable - absolutely no pain. I can fall asleep with them in my ears and they are still there when I wake up. The sound quality and noise cancellation is better than any other headphone or earbuds I have ever tried. They feel durable and high-quality - they work like a charm. I am absolutely in love. I never want to take them out of my ears because they give me such peaceful quiet, but are comfortable enough that I forget they are even there.I do wish they had multipoint as I tend to use two devices at once fairly frequently, but I am hopeful that they will come out with an update about that sometime in the future. Wireless charging would also be nice, but it's totally not a requirement.Other than that, I have absolutely no complaints. It's also worth noting that they seem well-protected in their case. The magnets are good and, unlike my UE fits that drop out of my case super easily, these have strong magnets that keep them well in place so I feel more comfortable taking them places.If you have small ears, I'd definitely recommend trying these. They are the best ones I have ever found and I have tried A LOT of earbuds, including custom-made ones, that did not work at all. These have so many different configurations you can alter and shift, which means they really do have a size for everyone. Plus, they are high quality with almost all of the modern-day features you would expect them to have.TL;DR:As someone with weird ears that don't even work with custom earbuds, these are perfect. I never want to take them off.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2023",AF4YRZRQDMQ45N7DZRVEE4PN5RQA,True,24,Color: Soapstone

The sound quality is superb. The fit is extrodinary. The battery life is amazing. The noice cancelation is unbeliveable. The problem? Getting them to stay connected. I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max, an MSI WS-75 Workstaion Laptop and an HP Envy laptop that I have the Bose QC Earbuds 2 connected to. I followed all of the instructions, yet in my office, the earbuds will stay connected to my iPhone for just shy of 2 minutes. I reconnected them 8 times before I switched to the MSI laptop - and that wasn't much better. I have resynched them several times, I have cycled the power on the phone repeatedly...in other words I have done everything that I have read to do (and the Bose website is not much help). I am going to try for another week before I send them back. (I am currently on my front porch with Walter the cat, and they have now stayed connected to the iPhone for about 8 minutes). I WANT to love these (I have had a pair of wired in ear Bose earbuds for 8 or 10 years and love them) - the noise canceling has litterally changed my life (I am riddled with ADD and these help me stay on task when working), but if I can't get them to stay connected, I am going to send them back and shop for something else.UPDATE. One week exactly and I have intiated a return from Amazon - they are so annoying I could not use them any longer. When you start looking for answers on line about the connection issue (the only issueI had with them) you find that this is very very common, and the only work around that Bose has is ""resync them"", and they want to blame ""interferance"". When I am away from anything that can cause interferance, with my iPhone sitting on the tabel in front of me and they won't stay connected fro longer than a couple of minutes....there is something more going on than interferrance.

R219EN7R2SXA8B,B0B4PSQHD5,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Audio, Great Fit, Features/Connectivity Need Improvement",UnderWaterSuperHero,4,"I purchased these primarily because I’ve owned and have loved everything about my experience with the Bose QC35II Headphones. Also, the reviews about the audio quality from those who have used competing brands and especially from those who have compared the BOSE earbuds to the BOSE headphones made me relatively certain that I would be satisfied with the audio quality of these earbuds.The connectivity features of the BOSE earbuds however, are lacking. Things that you think should work intuitively, don’t always. For example, the earbuds don’t automatically connect to the last source they were connected to when you put them away, and there is no way to select a different (paired) source using the touch-sensitive controls on the earbuds. Instead, you have to go to your TV or PC or phone’s Bluetooth settings to connect the earbuds, and that isn’t always as reliable as you would expect. I don’t like having to rely on using an app or placing the earbuds in the case to switch sources.A glaring omission with the app is that while it does provide charge level indications for each earbud, WHY is there NO CHARGE LEVEL INDICATION FOR THE CASE?!?!?! It’s very annoying to place your discharged earbuds in the case for an hour, thinking they will be fully charged, only to remove them from the case and discover that you only have less than a full charge, sometimes far less than a full charge, because the case ran out of power. There is no way of knowing how much charge remains in the case. I hope that BOSE updates the app to add an indicator for case charge level, if the case hardware even supports doing that . . . It may not even be possible, and that would be an even greater disappointment.All things considered, I am very happy with the BOSE QC Earbuds II. They sound amazing, fit well, deliver best-in-class noise reduction, provide a decent feature set and are, ultimately, worth the high price of admission as long as they provide me with this level of enjoyment for at least as many years as my Bose QC35 II headphones have done.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2023",AEGYRW3XXD6H72DOXGGDPYZXQMOA,True,24,Color: Triple Black

RK67DLRU7J478,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars AMAZING ear buds,Caroline,5,"The other day right before a business trip I managed to lose one of my Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, and was ready to order a replacement pair. As far as I knew, they were great - except that I could never get the fit quiet right, no matter what replacement size (and brand) tips I tried. Which means that a yawn or sometime talking was enough for one to fall out, and when I went on runs, it was always a little iffy.Being a Bose fan, I decided to try these out. I own the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, which were a must on long flights as the above mentioned buds did not cancel the noise quiet as much as I would like, which I attributed to being a bud. I was hesitant as I have had some connection issues with bose (when it connects to two devices), but in the end I opted for these.Hands down, these are the best purchase ever. Out of the box, the fit was great. I can yawn, shake my head, run, etc. and both buds feel secure. Even better, I barely notice that they are there.The noise cancelling is the best I have ever experienced - better than my now three year old Bose 700 over the hear headphones. On the plane, a simple touch goes from ""aware"" when Im ordering a drink"" to ""noise cancellation"" which is outstanding - even the PA annnouncements are severely muffled and very low decible. While I have not played with creating new modes, know that you can if you have particular needs for environments.The touch controls are intuitive and easy to use - somehow I find it easier than with the Samsung buds and Bose over ear headphones, but maybe I am just bias and excited with these new ones.And the sound quality? Also amazing. I'm no expert on this front, but I can say it is superior to both my over the ear Bose (which to me were the gold standard), misc. bluetooth speakers I have, and the samsung buds. I cannot describe it.As for connectivity issues - so far all is good, though I am not sure I know all the details yet (like if they can connect to two devices and the auto connection).One thing that made me hesitate was how waterproof they are, but in the end, I realized at most they would experience rain, maybe a quick drop in the snow (not likely as I'd have a hat or headband on), and sweat. These are rated for those kinds of water interactions. I've never droped headphones or earbuds in water or needed them to survive being submerged, and I do not see that changing, so I am not worried.Overall, I would say they are worth the increased price over others.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2022",AEA5FQSSECS7OSGHZJC7F2IA3QTA,True,23,Color: Triple Black

That means very normal sounds are quite painful to my ears.The sound canceling on these earbuds is shockingly good. Shockingly good. You could be sitting right by a fan and that noise is going to disappear completely.I can use earplugs in the real world but then I can't really hear what people are saying. These earbuds work as they should they cancel a lot of outside noise while still allowing you to speak and hear within an acceptable range. That is life-changing for me.The app is frustrating to use so far. These things demand to be paired even though they don't need to be paired to anything in order to work with the sound canceling. So I have to pair them to the app and then mute the app in order to use them like they would if no app existed. And it's not even the app that the earbuds themselves demand to be paired to a device. I don't want that but I haven't yet found a work around. Because if I don't have Wi-Fi or I'm not in an area where they can be paired then they just constantly bark to be paired. It's very unnecessary and very annoying. It's possible that I will find Solutions as these are quite new to me.I don't know what the sound quality is like in frankly I don't care. These are strictly sound muting devices for me and for that purpose they seem to be very effective.

RYQL05GYTJGOA,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars Connectivity issues hampered otherwise great performance,Pelin C.,3,"These earbuds sound great, and the noise cancellation technology is very impressive. Even if I do not have any sound playing at the moment, I found it difficult to even have a conversation with someone while wearing the earbuds with quiet mode enabled. The battery life was great, and I also was able to get a great fit in my ears through trial and error with the various included sizes (historically I have had trouble with other brand earbuds staying in place).With all of that said, I had two different poor experiences with these buds. First, every now and then the audio would have some weird quirk where the sound had an echo (for lack of a better word) and sounded off. It typically just lasted a few seconds, and would happen randomly. That bug was annoying, though if that were the only issue I would have likely ignored it. My much more significant bad experience with these earbuds involves connectivity issues. I used these with two different devices, and switch back and forth between devices was pretty simple. After a few weeks, however, my earbuds would randomly completely stop working with either one or both of the devices, and I would have to re-connect and pair them with the device again. The connectivity issue kept getting worse over time, where I had to attempt multiple restarts and pairings to get them to work again, and it got to the point where it would lose that connection after just a few days. This was too much for me, so I ultimately returned them.In summary, to the extent my earbuds were not uniquely defective, if these bugs are worked out, the earbuds are otherwise an excellent choice.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2024",AE73FZEIPS6Y3LBT6VP6WW62ANMA,True,0,Color: Soapstone

Unfortunately, not even Bose is a match for this snorer. They do not cancel out the snoring. I've even tried playing Pandora through the earbuds and I can still hear the snoring. Additionally, they don't stay in the ears while sleeping. So, I've resorted to having to wear these with Pandora music playing while also wearing a pair of over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones to try to drown out the noise.

They are more comfortable to wear than the first-gen Bose QC, and the performance is better. The sound quality and noise cancellation are absolutely fantastic and better than the QC I. I had some issues with pairing the QC I buds with devices that could not install the app, but these pair fine, app or not. Range from the source seems slightly better, as well.The app is pretty good if limited in function. I very much appreciate the ability to select another source in the app (even if I need to connect it to the device I am using first). Occasionally, the app is not able to find the earbuds if I open the app before I take an earbud out of the case, but that's easily fixed. My biggest complaint about functions is that you have only 2 options when it comes to a shortcut (either changing the ""mode"" or activating the voice assistant--pretty lame--I'd like to see more options there.The microphone has very good fidelity, but it picks up every single little breeze. That makes it, at least, very irritating when trying to talk to someone on the phone while outside, and it can even be nearly impossible. That really needs to be fixed.I've yet to run the battery dry, so I cannot comment on battery life. However, it seems to be at least as good as advertised if you can trust it's own assessment of how much charge remains.But that brings us to the only real, glaring disadvantage over the QC I. The QC II case does not have wireless charging. I don't know what's going on with that or who thought that was a good idea.

This is the reason I got them to begin with. I’m stopping the praise there because I don’t think ear buds should be praised for staying in ones ear.The mic in these are also better for phone calls in the outdoors (I’m told by people I’m talking to) as they do better at blocking wind from overtaking the mic and muting your voice.HOWEVER, the positives end there. The connectivity of these to my iPhone, iPad or basically any electronic device I’ve used them with is laughably bad. I mean, truly, comically terrible at staying connected to your device while playing your music or podcast or audiobook. I have yet to go a single session without the program I’m listening to cutting out, sounding robotic, or having the two ear buds being out of sync. Yes, I always start by putting the right one in my ear first and waiting for the ding-dong and battery level verification before putting in the left earbud (which, how dumb is that). I still, without fail, have many interruptions through my workout or conversations due to some type of connectivity issue.The sound, if they connect, is what you’d expect from Bose headphones, right up until the point you hear static or out of sync earbuds that sound like your listening to wired headphones with an exposed wire.Lastly, they are huge. The case is huge and if you have a case protector to protect your $250 pair of ear buds, they are way too big to comfortably keep in your pocket. I have to clip them to my work bag so I don’t have a second bulge sticking out of my pants.I’m super disappointed in these earbuds but am past my return date so my only choice is to make sure I do my part in preventing someone else from making the same mistake.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AFOQ4HXVW3IJRIPDVFQTGAMDGM7Q,True,0,Color: Triple Black
R1WD9G5D7V08GV,B0B4PSQHD5,"3.0 out of 5 stars I like them more than airpods, except they are very delicate.",Loki,3,"Short review:An upgrade in every way to their previous earbuds. Better noise cancellation, better charging case, at least as good of fit (it feels just as secure as the last ones in my ears). Useable for long periods of time without discomfort (the previous ones would hurt my ear after awhile), I have used these from full to zero twice now without any notable discomfort. The sound is at least on par with the previous version, my brain says it's better but my mind says it's about the same. Overall I like them better than airpods, but I would not recommend these over airpods for another reason; see below.My experience with these Bose earbuds:At first, quite happy; used them with no issues for several weeks. The case slips my hand and falls to the floor one day, and one earbud stops working as a result; returned the unit and got a replacement, no fuss; props to Bose there.Second unit goes same as the first, I use it for a few weeks but then instead of dropping the whole case, I drop one earbud while sitting in a car. The earbud did not break entirely, but now it has a persistent scratching noise that happens about a minute after it powers on. Tried various different fixes, nothing worked; I have now sent that one in for replacement as of writing.Assuming they send me a third unit, I will apparently need to be supremely careful in my handling of these extremely delicate earbuds. Between the second unit breaking and me returning it for replacement, I waited a couple months, instead using some apple Airpods daily. Like I mentioned above, I like the Bose earbuds better in a vacuum. Comes down to personal preference; they are not really much better than each other in any aspect other than durability. Over the course of two months using the airpods daily, I have dropped the entire case two or three times and individual buds once or twice. No breaking, no malfunctioning, no visible damage. This is especially strange considering I had Bose's previous QC earbuds, the first version; I still do have them, and they have been subjected to way more abuse than these newer QC buds and the Airpods combined and still function just fine. Something about the new design, while better than the first design, just isn't durable enough for day to day use. I would recommend the apple Airpods instead.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2023",AGXD6HDZDA4OZRL7KSVGTMFYN7CA,True,54,Color: Triple Black
R1TDGGSZRMJQLV,B0B4PSQHD5,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, but some issues",Alexis Aquino,3,"TLDR: great sound, but there are issues that shouldn't occur at this price point.The noise canceling is great, but it's biggest weakness is wind. If you are trying to use it outside, you will hear the wind if there is anything stronger than a breeze (even at its highest noise canceling setting). Because of that, it works great indoors, but is less than ideal outdoors. I have also had issues occur where both the ear buds would connect, but only one will play audio. For me, it's usually the right bud that connects but doesn't play audio. When this happens, the right bud can still be used to pause and skip, but no sound comes out. Additionally, noise canceling does not work will this occurs since both buds need to putput audio. Meaning that this not uncommon problem takes away the biggest selling point of these earbuds. The easiest solution I've found to this is to place the buds in the case and charge the case (just placing the buds in and closing the case has not consistently worked). While this is an easy enough fix, it is not a problem I expected to have at this price point. Furthermore, if you are on the go, you may not have a charger on you and will have to wait for access to it.","Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2024",AENY7MROWUYFVI7UEHYN4FCZ6MJQ,True,1,Color: Triple Black

I ultimately went with Bose due to their recognized reputation. While I am overall happy with them, there are some negatives I'd like to share. First, they are a bit difficult to remove from the charging case. I have taken to ""flicking"" them to get them to come out. Similarly, i use them to watch movies occasionally while in bed. They are a bit difficult to seat properly in the case without shinning a light on them - kind of undermines my reason for using them to watch something to subsequently fall asleep to. The lack of Qi or wireless charging is also a bit of a detraction. For earbuds in this price range, that should be a standard in this day and age.I sought out active noise cancellation as I travel frequently. I have not yet had the opportunity to try the active cancellation on a plane as of yet.The app or software that governs the ""modes"" and what not, should, IMHO, have more than the currently 4-preset noise cancellation modes, and, though it may be available, I haven't found it yet, the software / app for a laptop or desktop.Overall, they aren't bad, with the additions of the items mentioned above though, they could become exceptional.","Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2023",AH6UCD5BOGGLDZCZ4X7YXRRXC36Q,True,9,Color: Triple Black

R3HI6YRRFWOLZH,B0B4PSQHD5,"5.0 out of 5 stars Best in Class Noice Cancelling, Very Good Audio, and Fit Options, Poor Connect Application",Charles M.,5,"I decided on the QC2 after trying Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Sony Wf-1000xm4, and Audio Technica ATH-TWX9. The Audio Technica have a better sound signature (for my liking) and have the look and feel of a $300 earbud. The mid and highs have a brilliance that the others I tried don't. However, I could only get them to seal using aftermarket tips that were uncomfortable and the noise cancelling was mid-tier at best. The Bose had Alternate Tips and stability bands, XXS and XL, on their website and I needed the XL. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable. Other manufacturers should take note. Another no brainer for a flagship Earbud would be wireless charging, which Bose does not support. Not a deal breaker for me but another miss.The Bose connect App is, frankly, not good. The Apps for all of the Buds I tried were better and THEY STAYED CONNECTED. The QC2 box states ""Made for iPhone, Works with Android"". I would assume that the App problems might be better with iPhone but is very frustrating using my S22 Ultra. I have to connect to it numerous times throughout the day and at least once a week I have to re-pair the Buds to my phone as the App can't find the device although it is actually paired to the phone. I would also like at least a 5-band equalizer in place of the 3-band.Another shortcoming is Codec support. While the QC2 supports SBC and AAC it lacks any type of APTX or the higher resolution LDAC. Hopefully this will be corrected in an upcoming firmware update.Bottom Line for me is I can for a while tolerate the poor App because the really good Noise Cancelling, very good audio quality and a really great fit. If we can get APTX HD or Lossless and invest some money into the Connect App these will be hard to top.UPDATE: I have been using these steadily for 3 weeks now and must say I'm quite impressed. After tweaking using The Equalizer the sound is excellent. I can wear these for hours and actually forget I have them in. The noise canceling is world class. I've learned to live with the app although I do wish it would stay connected, but definitely not a deal breaker.

I had the wired earbuds for years and they were fantastic- and finally wore out after daily use for years. So, enter these. They drop calls like crazy, people can't hear me, and they randomly connect to things in the case or out. The noise cancelling is never fully ""off"" (which I knew ahead of time but didn't think would be a problem). My biggest issue is that I bought them to seamlessly go between listening to music or my computer (pairing to two sources) and taking phone calls. These don't work for any of it. It has been an incredibly frustrating experience and, because I bought them on amazon, Bose won't refund me (understandable but wish I would have known that when I bought them). Bose sent me the Quiet Comfort Ultra and it has the exact same problems. Incredibly frustrating that my clients can't hear me (""you keep dropping out"") and in the middle of watching a movie while flying (or listening to music at my office), each pair (of 4) has just stopped working. Randomly. I'm not doing anything different. It just says ""iphone lost."" Absolutely not worth the money and they don't do what they are touted to do. I just want other to know these are not great. I've done all the resets, deleted the Bose app (because it was allegedly the problem), etc. Been on the phone with tech support multiple times for each pair. Nothing works. They just suck. And because I bought them here, can't get a refund, but can get a replacement of the same poor product. When they work, the sound is pretty good. The calls never sound great, though.

That said, the wired version of the QC I've been using with my iPhone for several years fits in my ears tighter and gives me better noise cancellation. The wired version uses stability bands that extrude from the earbuds, keeping them more securely in place, and the ear tip material is a little stiffer which, for me, works better.This all apparently differs between individuals, so they may work well for you, as they seem to have done for others. It's just the comparison falls a bit short for me. The charging case is nice, battery life is okay for me, and the quality overall seems excellent. The wired version cost nearly as much as these several years ago, so the price for these is okay in my opinion.I use mine mostly at home while exercising on my elytical machine.

The Sony's sounded fantastic and the noise cancelling was great. But the battery life of the earbud is unacceptable. I tried several things I saw in the web but the battery life on the right earbud won't go more than an hour.I first bought the AirPods Pro 2 because I operate in the apple ecosphere. I tried for a few days but ended up returning it because the ANC is no where good as the Sony. I work out of a Starbucks an hour or two everyday and the AirPods were letting in way too much noise.So, I am now trying out the Bose. Here are a few observations:- The ANC is fantastic...perhaps even better than the Sonys. I haven't done a side by side test at Starbucks but the ANC blocks out an amazing amount of external noise.- The sound is not on par with the Sony. The XM-4 has a cleaner and crisper sound- I get close to six hours on the earbuds with ANC on. I can't speak to the longevity of the batteries as I've only had these for a few weeks.- Comfort and fit is excellent.Overall, I am very pleased thus far. The best trait - ANC. I just hope the batteries will be better than the Sonys.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2023",AH55B3L3CXPHJXOUDUKRRXUBXX7Q,True,12,Color: Triple Black

I was a little suspect about earphones but my goodness they are incredibly effective. The comfort from being able ot pick between earbud and stability band sizes is a huge gamechanger - normally I just accept that earphones will hang loosely in my ears, but these can accomplish a secure and very comfortable fit.Pros: sound is great, and you can fiddle around with the balance in the Bose app (I increase the mid and trebles from the default). Comfort as mentioned before is incredible, although I have yet to have worn them any longer than ~2 hours. Battery as far as I can tell is more than good enough for my usage (listening to music and audible books during my commute, so about ~3 hours a day).My first criticism, is the case hinge feels pretty weak. I don't remember if it started that way, or just having it in my pocket for a few days has soften the case joint, but it feels like the build quality of the case is a little shy of what you'd hope for at this price point.My second criticism is the noise canceling, when put into ""Aware"" mode, seems to rely on having multiple sound levels to distinguish background noise from other noise. Background chatter is only made quieter if someone is talking to me, and then gets louder when the conversation ends, which results in the background noise oscillating in volume. Also loud sounds (like a train horning its arrival) seem to screw around with it a bit.My third criticism is that the left earbud seems reasonably prone to dropping the connection. I've had it for about a month, and about 3-4 times I've needed to put both earbuds in to redo the pairing. It seems most prone to doing this if I take one earbud out to better hear the surrounding world, where when I put that earbud back in it struggles to pair it again.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2022",AGMTN3JKWCH6TJAOWC2OMCQNZEFQ,True,34,Color: Triple Black

I can tell you right now the fit is way better and the noise-cancelling as well. I feel the sound quality in the Sony XM5's is better but not by much so I'm happy with the Bose.

One of those earbuds finally stopped working so I figured I'd give the new ones a go. I've had them for a little over a week now and they are a downgrade in every single aspect other than their form factor and comfort. Instead of giving you my life story, I'll give you what ya want.The connection issues are very real, these things are a nightmare to connect to anything. If you're often swapping devices with them, you're going to have a constant bottleneck in your life which will be getting these headphones to connect to anything. Then after you've finally gotten both earbuds to connect, they will randomly disconnect, for no apparent reason, from time to time too. One last thing about their connection issues: when I was connected to my PC with my old ones, if I had to go to the opposite side of the house or something - yeah they'd disconnect, but when I came back to my PC they'd reconnect seamlessly and it just worked. These not only do not reconnect, they never properly disconnect when out of range so you can't just reconnect them. You have to put them back in the case, mess around with your PC's Bluetooth settings until it says they're disconnected, then you have to go through the tedious process of getting them to connect again. It sucks.Now on to the case, it's trash. Yeah, it's slightly smaller than the other one but it lost wireless charging, doesn't have a latch like the old one, and it is not sturdy at all. It's the case for a $300 pair of earbuds and you could easily snap the lid off of it while putting it in your pocket because it's so flimsy. The headphones have almost non-existent magnets that hold them in the case and there is no latch or magnet for the lid at all. Thus, if you drop this case there is no chance the earbuds will remain in the case. I honestly can't believe Bose released this low-quality product as their ""flagship"" earbuds.Sound Quality - the same as the old model except if you hear something high pitch it will overload the speaker and make a very ""shrill"" noise in your ear that hurts. Overall, the sound quality has gotten worse from the last pair.Noise cancellation - is the same as the last pair, if not a little better because the overall shape, design, and fit of the new earbuds are much better than the first model.A niche issue but actually is the dealbreaker for me and is the reason I'm here giving a detailed bad review: There is not anywhere in the settings to turn the touch buttons off on the earbuds. I often go on long runs outside and once I start sweating, buttons start getting pressed by my sweat. This constantly disrupts my audiobook and my run flow. Now, these headphones are going back and I'll just buy a new pair of the first model QC Earbuds. Another reason I made sure I came and left a truthful review is because of the price point and brand of these earbuds. When you buy Bose, you expect top-quality, premium, dependable products.

Battery life is great - I don't have to plug them into the wall but maybe once a week. I can also sleep on my back with these in. Sleeping on my side is a little more tricky since you can't have your ears directly on your pillow but I do use them sometimes just to help me get to sleep - they work better than the QuietOn earplugs I have for noise cancellation and they don't hurt the insides of my ears like all earplugs eventually do. Also, I do not have the mobile app for this, but for my purposes, I don't need it; It does what I want it to do as far as noise cancellation which is the primary reason I got these.

The noise cancelation is sometimes startling when it first comes on, but you get used to it and it's very good. The case feels solid and sleek. I am disabled and struggle slightly to get the buds out of the case. I like having customization options for the different rubber parts of the buds, they stay in my ears quite well. Overall a wonderful purchase on my partner's part.","Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2023",AG2PNJ3IAQNDBNDFAKYTZ4QINBSQ,True,5,Color: Eclipse Grey

I bought the Bose Soundsport used a few years back and they were good but bulky sticking out of my ear and no noise cancellation. I've tried airpods and hated them due to connectivity and how awkward they felt in my ear. I finally broke down and sold all those and bought the Bose quiet comfort and I'm very happy with them! They came in 60% charged which was great cause i wanted to try them out immediately. Simple set up with the software and connectivity and once that was done i put them on and they fit very well.I run a fan and an air cleaner in my room since I live in the middle of the city, so my room is usually noisy; once i put on the headphones it took a minute, but the sound cancellation kicked in without me realizing it was a default setting. For a moment i thought we lost power to the rooms cause the noise from the fans just gradually vanished! The sound comes in crystal clear, and the noise cancellation makes it feel like you're listening to music in a soundproof room. I've only had them for a day so i'm looking forward to working out with them, doing calls and listening to music on the go. I'll glady update after a few more weeks with trying them out but for now i'm super happy with my buy!UPDATE: 1/14/2024Couldn't be happier with my headphones!! I game them a real test and work out with them at the gym to see how well they held up. When the noise gets too much to where i can't focus, i kick on noise cancel and the whole gym goes dead silent! The touch response for volume is amazing and switching between calls, noise cancel/aware modes is easy.

R7DFF4ME3W0NW,B0B4PSQHD5,4.0 out of 5 stars Feels like a downgrade,Michael,4,The noise cancellation is cool but you can't turn it off there's just a digital pass through so hope your never unwrapping cellophane (unlikely but excruciating) with these on but it makes all external sound seem a little weird. The left one never works on it's own (I'm told there is a fix for this). Compared to my soundsports the sound is cleaner but that seems like a side effect of the noise cancellation because music doesn't as good. Then they don't do dual channel and will only connect to one device. They fit really nicely but seems like the tech is going in the wrong direction. I would wait a few generation before buying the newest model from Bose again; your essentially paying to test their R&D at this point. The right reviews will point you to cheaper older better stuff with Bose.

R3TDXRAU8VQVTW,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars Noise cancellation and fit are excellent. Software and connectivity flaky and outdated.,J.M.,3,"Good: Excellent noise cancellation. Completely blocks fan hum noise, most of TV sound and conversations. Taking out one earbud pauses media play and disables noise cancellation. Once re-inserted, the media starts playing and noise cancellation activates. This is very helpful when you need to talk to someone briefly. Comparison: Bose QuietComfort 2 95% noise reduction Samsung Buds 2 40% Jabra Evolve 75 30% I can wear the Bose QC 2 for >2 hours easily and sleep with them. They don't fall out. Samsung Buds 2 get loose and easily fall out after moving my jaw too much. Ridiculous. I can't wear any over the ear headset comfortably for more than 20 minutes.Bad:In-ear detection is problematic.I finally learned that, when inserting, I have to firmly press and hold the bud into the ear for 2 sec before letting go for the ear detection to work. Once the bud activates in the ear, there are no further issues.Before I learned how to do that I resorted to a complete reset which requires many steps and time.No tracking for the buds or the case.No indication of how much charge the case has.Cannot automatically switch between two devices.Manual switch is problematic. It may require shutting off the bluetooth on the device you are trying to disconnect from.No wireless charging. Really? It is 2023.Occasionally the app can take 10 sec to connect.I had to exchange original order because the buds could no longer connect to the phone app.Good thing it is simple to replace with Amazon if the problem happens early on.Bose must improve it software and quality control.You may feel slight ear pressure from noise cancellation. Mind you that ear plugs are 10 times more uncomfortable. People with very good hearing may hear slight white background noise when surroundings are completely quiet. This doesn't seem to bother anyone much.Price is steep but if you pay half as much, you will get a quarter of the noise cancellation quality.There is much to improve. Would I buy it again?

I have several pairs of the lesser Vibes, which sound good, but these blow them out of the water.First, let's address the fitment. I see many say they don't fit, they fall out, or feel like they're going to fall out. Don't put the large ear pads on if you don't have large ear canal openings! This will cause the earbuds to push themselves out. Too large will push them out, while too small will obviously not have enough to grip your ear. Test them all to find the right fit, if not, reach out to JBL, I'm sure they have replacement pads of other sizes. You can also buy them here on Amazon as they're pretty universal.I find pushing them in, and turning them into place, with the proper pads, netted a great seal and no falling out.You HAVE to install the app on your phone; otherwise, you're getting the flat sound your phone manufacturer decided sounded good. The JBL app is available for Apple and Android - and it makes a massive difference, especially with the noise cancellation and frequency response.With these, I'm hearing songs I've listened to for decades for the first time. I'm hearing effects and instruments I never heard in the music. These are that clear. They also don't kill my ears! I've tried earbuds from $5 to $300, and while the more expensive ones sounded terrific, they hurt my ears physically. With these, I get great sound and a great fit with a tremendous battery life.I'm reading a lot of negative reviews where either the fit or the sound is the problem. Most of these would be positive if people were provided with either longer pads so they go a bit further into the ear and more sizes and those with sound complaints would actually install the app. Mine sounded horrible with the Dolby equalizer baked into Android 13. Installing the app AND turning off any phone equalizer or sound enhancer was the solution. I'd definitely buy these again!","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AHRX7NNP5PFTRE7ODNC2FV7G3Q3Q,True,71,Color: BlueSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds
R1PM8XR6N66HJO,B0C1QDNP2G,5.0 out of 5 stars Mastering Engineer Approved,Jenn,5,"A lot of pros with one con.I didn’t think I had a lot of time for earbuds during the day, so I started off trying a cheap pair. They were $20 or something with 4.8 stars and reviews like, “I haven’t used my Airpods since buying these!” so I thought that sounded perfect.They sucked. The sound was harsh, they became painful after extended use, noise cancelling was barely noticeable, etc. I can’t actually remember all of the problems at this point. BUT they sold me on the functionality of wireless headphones.Fast-forward to a few months later - it’s Black Friday and I bite on these because they’re on sale. I was a little hesitant because they had a lowly 4.2 stars. Turns out average reviews aren’t everything.These are the polar opposite of the highly-reviewed, cheap headphones I tried: they’re comfortable, and the sound is amazing. As the title implies, I master audio so this is not a hollow endorsement. The cheap ones had hyped bass, missing mids, and painful presence/treble. These are very flat and well-performing by comparison, and can be EQ’d. The noise cancelling is also VERY respectable. I frequently work around loud sources and am sensitive to loud noises, and I have accidentally left these in when I intended to swap for earplugs, because the performance is similar.I love the app. Being able to select between audio quality vs. video sync’ing is awesome when I want to watch live musical performances where sync issues play with your mind. Being able to create custom EQ settings is very important to me too.The con is that you have to take them out of the case to power them on. It’s not a huge deal - it’s easy to pop them in for a split second if they’ve timed out or something. But there has been one occasion that I ran somewhere and forgot the case. I intend to live my life without dependence on crap like headphones, so no big deal - take a break.I would normally give something like this 4 stars because that power-on function is a notable miscalculation on JBL’s part, but it deserves a much better average review than it has so I’m doing my part to raise it. In everyday life it’s not that big of a deal unless you’re the kind of person who loves to find things to complain about.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AFO7HNFRBAYYCEYUNPA4KKJ3ZWTA,True,75,Color: WhiteSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds

These JBL Tune buds produce a good sound with my iPhone, especially when using the JBL app which has preset equalizer settings for different sounds and can deliver amazing base. Overall these are fairly good earbuds at a sale price of around $50. The box includes 3 pairs of silicon tips, small, medium and large, the silicon material is too smooth and too thin, they slide out easily and do not sit very securely for me, but this is very subjective and can be different for everyone. The noise canceling is only ok, in my opinion it provides about 40-50% background noise cancelation (personal opinion, not scientifically measured). The sound quality is very good but it seems the volume level seems low compared to other buds I have.

Ever since using the airpod wingtip, the noise cancelation and fit is SO MUCH MORE comfortable than just wearing straight out the packaging. Highly recommended.

Capsule charge was at 75% while both buds were at 100%.Next I tried placing them in my ears. When i placed them in my ears and turn them counterclockwise the weren't very comfortable and felt loose like they were going to fall out, however they did say in place when i tilted my head to either side and shook my head. These earbuds are supplied additional ear cushions. I tried the bigger ones and for my ears these were too big for my ear canal and would not stay in very well. I tried the smaller ones and these wouldn't hold in place. I'd like to say they were like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, but none were just right. The closest for me were the medium size, but I still didn't trust them staying in while doing yard work.Today was the first day I've had to really put them to the test. I place them in and fiddle with them for a bit to get a ""snug"" fit. The only way I could achieve this was by turning them so that the J in the JBL logo was at about a 180 degrees facing upwards.I started Spotify and proceeded to start the yard work. I noticed myself constantly fiddling with the earbud, because the kept feeling like the were going to fall out, enough so that I kept activating the voice pass through.After about a hour and a half into the yard work I was met with a bluetooth disconnected message. When I looked at my phone (Samsung galaxy s23 ultra) it showed bluetooth was enabled and the buds were paired. I started Spotify again and the music resumed. So I was like ok????I did about another 2 hrs of yard work and they stayed connected, but I still constantly felt they were going to fall out.With today's experience, I will not be using these near my poolWould I recommend these to a friend?

I feel it necessary to say I purchased these at 50% off, and for that price they are definitely worth it. At $100, I would definitely go for Samsung's or something similar.Here is the rundown.Pros:- Long battery life- Good noise cancelling, about 50-60%% effective or so (not as good as headphones obviously, but good)- Sleek design- Can adjust to stay in your ear pretty well- JBL app is available for Android at least, and allows you to easily manage and fine tune your audio experience which is greatCons:- get very uncomfortable after wearing for a while (could be the particular fit piece I use or way I'm wearing them, not sure, but it hurts after awhile)- noise cancelling, while good, is not amazing, and it causes noises outside to be kinda sharp and close-feeling (like someone yanking on your earbud cord back when earbuds were wired)Overall, great choice at $50. Like I said before though, I wouldn't recommend at full price because of the comfort and noise cancellation oddities. I have to go back to my Wyze wireless headphones after a while to give my ears a break.","Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2024",AGBS6TVIPR4NFFEPWK7ZHNV7URXA,True,5,Color: BlueSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds

R3CDU9S5XF66XB,B0C1QDNP2G,3.0 out of 5 stars Low-end Offerings,NORMAN GARCIA,3,"Purchased these JBL Tune Buds a few weeks ago as I had misplaced my Javbra 5 Buds and needed a quick and inexpensive replacement.Here are my observations:Fit - I am of average ear size (I think). I tried all three sizes of bud that came with the packaging. The medium size fit best but by best, I mean just adequate. The silicon buds were cheap feeling and lacked any stiffness that might have helped secure them better to my ear and helped/assisted the ANC when turned on.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) - I live in a metropolitan area that is chronically loud. If you live in a quieter area, these might work for you. For me, the ANC is poor to adequate and I suspect the ill fitting bud plays into this factor.Software - I feel the software is mediocore at best. I use these buds for playing music and for remote meetings via MS TEAMs. Once the TEAMs meeting starts the software deactivates ANC and you are able to hear the ""ambient' sounds from your surrounding environment. I can hear the meeting participants fine but they complain that they have trouble hearing me. They tell me that the barely hear my voice and instead hear the noise around me. Not sure of the logic making this ""auto ANC off"" for meetings a thing with the buds/software. Ultimately, I just listen and don't offer much feedback because it ends up being a distraction.Talk - On individual calls, friends and family hear me fine.Meetings - not recommended for meetings as the software is set to turn off ANC once a meeting begins.Gaming - I feel that young people could use these phones to game if they are in a quiet setting like their room.Price - I feel that these JBL Tune Buds were priced adequately around $50.Final Thoughts - If you are willing to pay $25 more I recommend Jabra 5 buds. Your ears will thank you for it.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2023",AFXEN64KEEJBIHRI5VNC3X77ZHQA,True,3,Color: WhiteSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds

On par with the good sounding off brand $30 sets. Big difference is that they have features that help with ambient sounds and has noise canceling. Thing though is I was very unimpressed with those features after owning a pair of Bose earphones. These were also really lightweight/cheap feeling compared to my Bose, and weren't as easy to use with the taps and stuff. Then there is the fitment issues. Do they have different size rubber pieces? Yes. 3 sizes, 1 set of each. None of them worked, to the point that almost every facial muscle movement or jaw movement caused them to fall out. Personally I like to be able to talk when I'm on a phone call, but these made it hard to. And trying to watch a movie while eating? Impossible! I spent more time catching/picking up my earbud and trying to resume the movie than I did eating.Ultimately my advice is that if you're not wanting to spend a lot of money on features like noise cancelation, take a chance with an off brand for a third of the price and you'll most likely still have the same sound quality. If you want thise features and are willing to pay this price, spend a little more and get Bose or a good brand that knows how to to it right.

Talk through can help in that case, but talk through make the volume lower by default and can't increase at a certain level.ANC works fine at this price range, but a hissing sound is there and sometimes feels annoying while in between songs.

Both times I purchased, they were on sale for $50 and they go on and off sale very often. Even for full price, they are well worth the money.The main reason i am writing this review….I had my first set for ~2 yearsMy first set of these went through hell. Dropped them in mud, sweat profusely through them on bike rides, covered in drywall dust, grease from working on the car, they even took multiple trips through the washing machine. On their second accidental trip to the washer, I told myself wife id write this review if they survived. They did. In fact, they still work! And have worked for the last 2-3 months excellently - no battery issues, no sound quality issues, nothing. And this is coming from someone who averages 70k+ minutes (that’s like 40 straight days) of Spotify listening annually. Seriously, I used the crap out of these things. The last few months of using them I had no f-ing idea how they still worked so well.I actually lost my first set (ended up finding them a few days later) which is why I purchased these new ones.These earbuds are a 10/10.

With the JBLs I was underwhelmed.After downloading and installing their software, as recommended, I gave another try. I felt like I was just listening to music with my old buds, didn't feel wowed by the JBLs for their expense. The difference in quality wasn't significant, the value just wasn't obvious to me. To be fair to the earbud industry, I've worked around machinery for many years, and likely have some hearing limitations that buds just won't overcome. Nonetheless, these are being repackaged and returned. I'm kinda brand- loyal, and as such just bought bluetooth JBL over ear headphones. We'll see how they do.

Although each of them has worked, they have all had a feeling of being 'pressurized' when you turn on the noise-cancellation (making you want to 'pop' your ears, similar to driving down from the canyon into the valley - as I am used to that living in an area with many mountain ranges). This pressure feeling has a tendency to make you feel very tired, very quickly, as well.This set of JBL headphones, however, do NOT make my ears/head feel like that when the noise cancelling is enabled. They are very clear and, I also like the adjustable 'level' of noise cancellation (although, it's not my favorite that you must use the App to make those, and some other, changes).I would recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2024",AGYAGV4P7GDMEGQN3L4TGX4FGQQQ,True,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds

Super comfortable to wear. Feels like you are not wearing anything. These buds don't stay on well if you were doing pushups, or yoga, or any exercise that requires explosive movement. They easily pop out. The Case is too flimsy. One drop and it is going to break.The sound is perfect for podcasts and just listening to music in the background. In comparison to the earlier version of the earbud, those were much better and created a better seal that delivered a better sound quality. The sound quality for this unit sounds hallow. The fit is a bit loose for my preference.**I haven't tried making or taking calls from this earbud. I'm unable to report the voice quality.Key note: these are not fully in ear and that is the design and purpose of it. The older unit earbuds were in ear, and you can feel the weight of it after long use. Easy to charge each earbud. It truly is a drop in without the guessing.Final thought.This item has it's place in the wireless earbud market. It's well worth the purchase at the price point being offered.

R39Q2V5XL8NNVS,B09JVG3TWX,5.0 out of 5 stars Really like the semi-in-ear design,A Guy,5,"My ears don't tolerate in-ear monitors very well, but I've been wanting something small to keep in my bag to save my bulky over-ear and on-ear headphones from getting thrown around too much. I've heard old OEM Apple ""hard"" earbuds that shoot sound into your ear canal without actually occupying them and was impressed with the sound quality for a non-sealing earphone. Seeing these in photos, they looked like they'd offer the best of both worlds by sealing slightly (also keeping them in place better) but still offering a sense of ambient awareness and being less uncomfortable to my irritable concha cavum. What the pictures didn't depict was the silicone skin that fits around the body and helps hold it in place better and seal slightly more. You can remove it if it's not to your liking, but I left mine on because it does a great job of keeping them in place (even after vigorously shaking my head), and the supplemented bass is nice. I find I can wear these for about two hours before I start to get mild discomfort, much better than the 30 minutes or so with sealing in-ear monitors. In short, I'm a fan of the design and hope more brands take note.Sound quality is competent for the price. It's not ""hi-fi,"" but it's still enjoyable. You'll get about 90% of the bass response of a fully-isolating earbud, which is pretty dang good. If I were to sum it up, I'd say they did a good job squeezing the best sound possible out of cheap components. It's enjoyable and pleasant enough, but experienced ears can tell it doesn't have the finesse of a more expensive model, particularly in the highs. Ultimately, I think these are very reasonably priced.Bass, mids, and treble can be adjusted in the Alexa app, which is nice, but I think the ""treble"" slider digs too much into the upper mids, so you can't get more treble without also making it more shouty. All told, I left mine at near default, just a slight boost of the ""mids"" (which I'd personally consider low-mids). The sound is very agreeable out of the box.Speaking of app, I appreciate how easy it is to customize controls. You can assign what they do to taps (1, 2, 3, hold) per side. You can also disable them, which I appreciate.As for other features e.g. Alexa integration, I can't say much because I don't use them that way. I'm happy to report that these indeed can be used perfectly without the Alexa ""gimmicks"" (if you see that as such). Just in case it isn't clear to someone, these use Alexa on your phone--they do not have Alexa built in by themselves.Visually and material/build-quality-wise, they're acceptable but not impressive. Pretty non-descript appearance, and materials are merely adequate. I'm not worried about longevity/durability, but these don't feel luxurious at all (nor should you expect them to at this price and featureset).I can't quite comment on battery life yet because I've only been using these for around 10 hours total (up to 2hrs at once). So far it seems to live up to its promise, maybe even exceed.SOUND: 80/100COMFORT: 90/100FEATURES: 85/100QUALITY: 70/100VALUE: 90/100---OVERALL: 85/100RECOMMENDED: YES>> ADDENDUMI feel like this information might be useful to someone at some point:Wearing just one earbud will NOT automatically switch to mono. It'll continue to play only its respective channel. I have a pair of JBLs that are smart enough to downmix when only one is in use, so I'm a little disappointed that these aren't smart enough to do that.Other than that, I'm still enjoying them.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AHJTPV4IWJ5JDQX7L2FGES5VQ7UA,True,43,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

R2C399OIO0P096,B09JVG3TWX,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these!,Rachael,5,"My friend gave me these to replace my second generation echo buds. I was very pleased with both the fit and sound quality. The the covers that come with the buds are wonderful because I have an issue that occurs with every earbud of this form. Due to my ear shape, my right ear can become inflamed and sores are a common problem with use of this style. A rubber ring fits around the flat end of the buds at the front which offers both grip and comfort to the ears. I vet much appreciate the inclusion of these with the product the application of the bud skin can be very frustrating as the material is rather thin and anyone with dexterity problems will need assistance to cover them if the skin becomes damaged. Even if assistance is available, replacement can still be difficult or completely impossible. The case seems to have a long battery life if the buds are left untouched, and even with much use, it can recharge roughly about three or for times, depending on the current battery of the buds themselves. Unfortunately, the case can open and the buds ejected from it, even with the magnetic charging contacted which made the purchase of a case paramount for safety. The sound is ok, but not optimal overall quality is a remarkably good value for the purchase price.","Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2024",AHZHHG3PQFNGYTGVGSA522AJCNRQ,True,0,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only
R1ZNPH86MA5TNE,B09JVG3TWX,5.0 out of 5 stars If you are planning on spending more for Ear Buds ... DONT!,Moss Parker,5,"I have both iPhone 12 Mini and Galaxy S20+ phones and these Amazon Echo buds work flawlessly with both. My primary phone is the iPhone, and that is the one I use most frequently when I am distance walking or cycling. Over the past two years I have tried over 20 different brands of under $100 Bluetooth earbuds. I also own two sets of Apple AirPods Pro. Without a doubt, the AirPods have the best full-frequency audio performance, and are the standard on which I have rated all of the other earbuds I have purchased. Also, if you get them to work correctly, they provide the best integration with Siri. About a year ago, I purchased a set of Skullcandy Grind Fuel earbuds. While they were substantially inferior in audio performance to the AirPods, they integrated very well with Siri. Unfortunately, my set as well as the sets I purchased for both my son and niece began to fail to charge within a few months, rendering them useless. In my quest to find the perfect set of ""cheap"" earbuds, I did find a set that provided audio quality that was indistinguishable from the AirPods. These are the TWS Wireless - T78. Currently I have three pairs of these earbuds (home, care and office). Although their audio quality is excellent, the Chinese instructions are useless and I have never been able to get them to do anything but act as Bluetooth earbuds for listening to music and podcasts. Since they are reliable for what I use them for and have great audio quality I just resigned myself to being content with them. That is, until I saw the Echo Buds (2023) advertised as part of the Prime Day sale for $39. For that price I decided to take a chance on them and they arrived today. WOW! In the hour, or so, that I listened to music and played around with Alexa on my iPhone (mostly calling people and controlling Pandora), I was astounded by their audio quality (that exceeds any other earbuds I have tried except for the AirPods and the TWS Wireless brands). While the quality is very close to those two earbuds, only somebody who works extensively with audio might be able to determine the difference. Also, the Alexa integration is superb, making them more useful for controlling things in the phone and making calls than even the Grind Fuel earbuds. For me, this is more than I could have possibly asked for in an earbud for this price. Even though the Prime Day sale is over and Amazon is selling these at $49, they are still an incredible value (and will be ordering pairs for both my son and niece to replace the Grind Fuel earbuds). The bottom line is that I doubt you will be disappointed by these earbuds, and unless you require ANC (which is the only feature they lack, and one that I think is overrated for earbud type headphones, anyway), you would be insane to purchase any other earbuds under $100.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2023",AE3ORZRCEZPHFNQV5AT27AZXRCBA,True,64,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only
RZC26RQ848HKO,B09JVG3TWX,"2.0 out of 5 stars Good attempt, but not an airpods (any generation) replacement!",Harvey,2,"To set the stage for my review, these Echo Buds are being used in a work setting attached to a MacBook Pro, used with Zoom and Teams calls, Apple Music, and Phone Calls received through my Mac. They get used everyday, and I do charge them 2 to 3 times per week based on my usage. I do not use these on my iPhone or any other device. I am comparing to Airpods (multi-gen since I have multiple pairs of AirPods, and Bose sport earbuds).First, the fit on this new design of Echo Buds is horrible with or without the protective silicone piece. I just can't get them to stay in my ears comfortably or with a somewhat snug fit. This means that I am always fidgeting with the pieces in my ear and sometimes activating a control by mistake. This is a problem, becuase if you are using them in a work setting like I am well then you are now focusing on earbuds instead of the work call you are using them for. I do like the fact that they seem to connect very quick just like Airpods do on a Mac. I have not had problems with managing controls like I do with my Bose product. There is no waiting for the blue light to sync, you just put them in your ear and away you go. With my Bose, it's hit or miss if they will even connect to each other when you pull them out of the case. Echo Buds work just like AirPods, pull them out of the case and they connect to the last used device that is on or a device that has them setup and paired. Sound quality is ok for in-ear buds that do not have noise cancelling technology. I would think that if I could get them to sit in my ears better that the sound quality would be great. A huge downside is the fact that these are the less expensive Echo Buds and there is no noise cancelling option. Come on, all headphones over ear and in-ear at this point should have the option for some sort of noise cancelling. I mean if I used these to work out, or in a crowded setting i would not want noise cancelling to be on because I want to hear my surroundings as well; however, when I'm on a call and need to focus I want the noise isolation that comes with my Airpods and my Bose products. The case is nice, but a little bigger than the standar Airpods case but equal to an Airpods Pro case. The only thing I don't understand and take note Amazon, is why you put your icon on the under side of the case. The piece that opens up the smaller lid is a blank canvas but the bottom is where you put the icon, why? That is a marketing design fail if you ask me! Standard USB-C charging is a plus over AirPods, but this is what I get with my Bose product so not a big decision point. I chose the light grey over the standard black, and the feel of the plastic material is nice and not shiny which I enjoy (probably should have just said matte finish!).To sum up my experience: If you need a pair of in-ear buds these are an entry level pair that work just fine. Don't expect a great fit, the design simply needs a minor tweak here and there (it's not you!), sound is good but not great, connectivity is perfect, range is on par with every other product, last a good amount of time on a single charge. Buy them if you don't want to spend $100+ but know that new product honeymoon won't last long.","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2023",AGW44UEGXFIKMO6VX3N6ISBWMBWA,True,23,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device Only
R28OWHPXNNBOPZ,B09JVG3TWX,3.0 out of 5 stars Funciona bien con sus peros (1 mes de uso continuo),eltuti,3,"Mi experiencia luego de 1 mes de uso activo.Un poco larga esta reseña pero quiero ser lo más objetivo y sincero posible, así que si deseas tomate un tiempo para leerla, no soy un experto ni nada, solo un consumidor final como la mayoría.Los audífonos tienen una muy buena propuesta, escuchar tu música pero estar atento a tu entorno y lo logra decentemente bien. No deja que te desconectes por completo así que siempre escuchas si te llaman, si hay un vehículo cerca, etc.Sonido: Suenan muy bien y es extraño, porque pensarías que al estar fuera del canal interno del oído no se iban a escuchar bien, y no, de verdad se escuchan bien. Claro, no perfectos ni los mejores en bajos y eso pero se escuchan bien.Touch y multimedia: Muy bueno y acertado, solo uso lo básico, pausa y atrás y adelante y funcionan perfectamente. No puedes controlar el volumen de forma física, siempre le puedes decir a Alexa que te los suba y lo baje y todas las demás funciones. Viendo videos en plataformas como TikTok y Youtube se escuchan bien y el lag es casi inexistente porque sí, hay un pequeño y minúsculo lag, pero no sé si es directamente por el móvil que estoy usando (Galaxy A13), tendría que probar con otro a ver si no sucede. En spotify funciona a la perfección.Comodidad: Aquí es donde tengo mi mayor problema con ellos, son cómodos la primera hora de uso, luego se va tornando incomodo al uso y llegan hasta a doler en el trago y antitrago del oído justo en la entrada del canal auditivo.Esto se debe a que no es flexible para nada el audífono, me explico, es una pieza plástica dura que tienes introducida parcialmente en el oído, esto se amortigua un poco con el recubrimiento plástico transparente que trae, pero no es suficiente, va doliendo al punto que tienes que quitártelos y esperar un buen tiempo antes de volver a usarlo, ese mismo plástico a las horas de uso por el mismo sudor se comienza a caer fácilmente, se vuelve muy resbaloso y tienes que estar secando el poco de sudor que vas provocando. Ya me sucedió que lavando mi vehículo se resbalo del odio y cayo uno de los auriculares dentro de una cubeta llena de agua (por suerte los saque rápido y los agite muy bien retirando toda humedad que pudo haber recibido, al principio sonaba medio raro pero después de algunos golpes más volvió a la normalidad… por suerte) se que no es la manera de usarlos más conveniente pero es para que tengan una idea que si sudas un poco se deslizan del oído fácilmente. NOTA: Aléjenlo del agua, no son a prueba de agua.La carcasa de carga y almacenamiento: el color de la caja se va perdiendo el color como de ser blanco hermoso a tener una coloración un poco azul claro y eso que casi siempre tengo la carcasa en la cabecera de mi cama que no es que ande con ellos encima, es raro como digo que se descolora así solo (Ver fotos).La velocidad de conexión: Es bastante lenta respecto a otros auriculares que he probado pero creo que se debe a que tiene que ser controlado especialmente desde la aplicación de Alexa y eso hace que por ejemplo usando el izquierdo, sacas el derecho de la caja y te lo colocas al oído dura varios segundos en conectarse (entre 3 a 5 segundo aleatoriamente) no es el gran problema pero ahí está. Eso sí, en la aplicación puedes ver el estado de carga de cada uno de los auriculares individualmente y la carcasa de carga (Puntazo).Conclusión: En definitiva son unos buenos auriculares, el punto que más me gusta es que al tener mi ecosistema Alexa en mi hogar me siento como un Dios dando órdenes desde mis oídos (Jajajajaja) todos mis visitantes quedan locos cuando ven que puedo apagar cosas, encender cosas, poner música, controlar el volumen, etc. desde mi cabeza prácticamente.La comodidad es el único factor que no sobresalen, son los primeros auriculares que me duelen al usarlos. Creo que tendrían en utilizar algún tipo de plástico semi-rigido para lograr el efecto que desean pero que sea cómodo para largas jornadas. Es mi recomendación y esta es mi reseña personal.Muchas gracias por leer hasta aquí. Los quiero y que tengan un excelente dia!","Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2024",AFHAMTW7RHEE3BTNRJ5CXYSU4GXA,True,2,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only
R3ON5KYL3XSORS,B09JVG3TWX,4.0 out of 5 stars An improvement in savings,That_GUY,4,"Like many who probably just got the item from the Prime Day sale, I figured I would take a chance on some sub-$40 buds. I've had the first-generation Echo Buds in the past and always used them for outside labor since they were more affordable and tended to fit in the ear better than my AirPods.Speaking in terms of comparing the buds to the previous generation, these are more in the style of AirPods instead of the traditional in-ear type experience (similar to Samsung).Versus Echobuds (previous generation)Not sound isolating, if you need that - get a different set.Sound just as good.Case much less annoying and takes up less of a footprint.Versus AirPodsThrough various promotions, I have three generations of AirPods - these fit just as well and probably slightly better than AirPods for me. They have a sleeve that goes over the top that helps them fit a little more snugly than AirPods. I have used these for a variety of functions, from casual use to exercise - the Echo Buds remain in my ear just as well.The sound is much better than AirPods and the Alexa app can adjust the EQ of the sound. The bass can actually be heard. I don't think they sound as good as some other high end options, but for $50 or less - these are on the money.The battery life so far has been impressive. I use the headphones every day and have only charged them fully twice. These are charged by a USB-C cable and FYI it doesn't come with a cable or charger, but you know you have one.Alexa integration - My music service is Youtube Premium and this actually works better with Youtube Premium than Siri. Alexa responds quicker than Siri in summoning and tends to be a little more helpful.Bud mounting - I thought I would hate the magnetic bud mounting system, but it has actually not gone wrong for me yet. I am curious how this will playout over long-term ownership, but it isn't that bad. Also, dropping the AirPods usually means that I am searching on the ground/floor for where they shot out. These Echo Buds have not shot out when dropped on the floor.Find my Buds - I set this feature up, but haven't really spent time with it. I am absolutely sure it can't be worse than the AirPods version.Phone use - The people I regularly talk to and who can barely hear me seem to barely hear me with these buds as well. I assume this puts them on the same level as the AirPods. You will probably have a better time with calls on these than I do with my people. Let's just blame them.Some complaints/negatives - The case isn't always that easy to open one-handed. I know this is a minor gripe, but it seems like I am regularly in situations where one-handed operation would be helpful.You only have to use the Alexa app to initially set the device up. Some of ya'll will hate that. I don't mind that, but it would be nice to see the battery power without having to open a separate app. I guess, I'm just saying that convenient Apple popup when you open the case is a cool feature!The case is white and that design doesn't make for readily available cases quite yet. This thing will be filthy by the time I actually begin looking for a case. The case also feels cheap compared to some other models.Connection - Connecting to the phone seems to have a slight delay. This isn't a huge deal because I can spare the possible second or two of delay, but some might be annoyed by this. I also had some interesting stereo delay between the two buds while watching a Youtube video. This so far has been an isolated event.Summary - I wouldn't pay $100 for these, but for $50 or less - these are fantastic. I can't speak for the Android experience, but the IOS experience has been decent and I would gladly purchase a few of these versus going the AirPod route. There are some minor oddities, but nothing significant that would hamper the enjoyment of the device. The Echo Buds sound much better than the AirPods at a fraction of the price. There are some minor setbacks as far as connection delay, but not enough setbacks to warrant the increased cost.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2023",AHSSSABPXAEDAVK4UNLRROGLOQSQ,True,239,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only
R1FJ7RZLC91UJD,B09JVG3TWX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Integration everywhere but sound only okay, I’m still learning their tricks",Quaketoys,4,"So I have a music loving 12 yo daughter. If she is awake and not watching a show or doing homework, music is playing and her nickname or at least the phrase she says the most is “Alexanext!”(haha) I’m a bit of a singer from back in the day so I get it. Songs stick in our heads and fortunately I enjoy her music. No really thank the goddess! It would be hard to survive THAT song played for the 233th time otherwise, but sometimes I wanna hear oThEr ThInGs (shocking, I know!). So I thought these would be good and convenient for around the house to escape.We do travel quite a bit and we all have new AirPods (I prefer the pro), I have the newest Bose headphones for plane trips and to concentrate when working, and I had the Bose quietcomfort buds (the husband borrowed them once and I don’t think I’m getting them back haha). Even so these sort of intrigued me for podcasts and books and other things, so although the kid was like “ Hey, cool. I want these,” from probably a TikTok, I thought I’d try them out first because they were only $35.Sound from these, to be brutally honest is only okay. Hopefully some skilled audiophile will upload the actual numbers, but these are average at best. I have tinnitus and some hearning loss (30% in my left ear probably from back in the day). These are not going to wow any audiophile or musicians with their sound quality. There’s noticeable loss in everything and if they were not Amazon specific but some generic brand, many would complain about $35. You’re going to miss those deep bass feels and forget surround sound type of experiences. These are not going to work for meditations, binaural beats, classical music, or psychoacoustic brain sync sessions (which I actually also listen to but I kind of figured these are not the devices for that). But for a podcast or a book in the background playing quietly to pick up right where you left off? Okay. They work.I haven’t played around with them enough yet to change my settings but the Alexa voice and chimes are super loud regardless of my sound settings which is jarring and annoying. Tapping lightly twice for the next song even sounds horribly loud compared to the AirPods and Bose quietcomfort. I gave up tapping after 3 songs because it sounds so loud, but even saying Alexa next it makes her play a jarring acknowledgment bong that is louder than the music, news, or podcast I was listening to. It doesn’t make sense! And even controlling sound on a podcast directly from my iPhone (instead of asking Alexa to resume) the sound loss on these is still off/odd. Ben sounds too far away from his microphone and Ronnie’s evil chuckle is too much bass 🤣 and that never ever happened with Bose or AirPods. If I switch back to my AirPods, the quality instantly improves but then I have to remember where I left off on that episode which was why I wanted these in the first place for the integration everywhere. With these, I can easily listen to a song or book or podcast or the news with Alexa while playing a quick phone game and it sounds okay enough to not justify going across the house to get something that sounds so much better. Or at least that’s what I’m telling myself 2 days in.So I’m giving three stars because they need work to get to the level of other way better devices already out there, that have been out for quite some time, but the integration for me plus the only $35 adds that fourth star. I’ll update after I keep playing around with them.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2023",AEGUOPQ272O26W4O2TN5M4WIBORA,True,75,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only
R11ASZ098M80V,B09JVG3TWX,3.0 out of 5 stars Good earphones but some issues keep them from being great,Hakeem,3,"(Long review. Take the time to read.)My best friend had bought a pair of these and he had told me to check them out. I love Amazon products so I knew I had to buy a pair of these. When I first started using them, I loved the sound quality of them and I still do. They feel comfortable in my ears even after a couple hours which is a problem with some earphones. However now after a few months later, I started to notice some issues with these. First off, these earphones have a find my earphones feature which my best friend who has an iPhone says it works wonderfully for him. I don't know if these earphones just work better with iPhones or something but they don't work good with my phone and I have an android. I have misplaced my earphones several times and I tried using this feature and it didn't work. Only worked one time and that was when my earphone case was open. I had just misplaced them earlier today and even though I had the case open, it wasn't lighting up or making sound so it's like this feature will only work when it wants to. Another feature that I find useless is the whole Alexa calling feature. It only works when it wants to. I tried calling my wife and when I did, it called off of my Amazon firecube device instead of calling off my earphones and I didnt know how to choose. One time I called my mom and I didn't hear my mom's voice. I heard a man talking to me instead which I found to be really weird. I don't know what is up with that but it was very weird and I know I had the right number. Another issue with this feature is that sometimes when I say Alexa, she doesn't respond to me and doesn't even answer my call commands. Very strange. So 2 big selling features don't work? That's a big problem. The third and final issue I can say about these earphones is that after these few months of having them, I have noticed that they die a lot quicker than usual. I usually would have to charge them once every 2 or 3 days but now they die every day and I'm using them maybe for a good 3 or 4 hours. That's ridiculous. This is supposed to be a top of the line product and they shouldn't be dying that quickly. Even 3 or 4 days is a little too quick as well but I can take that over having to charge them every day. Those are all my negatives that take these earphones from a 4 star to a 3 star. I do like these still but I don't know if I recommend for the issues I had just mentioned. They sound good and they do block out some good background noise when I'm listening but I have to question long time quality.","Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2024",AFDVUMUPLEG7R5SRJJMVBADUSIUQ,True,3,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

But she will give you an option to leave a voice note, that’ll do. One big CON that I have is the sensitivity of the taps when switching to songs or just anything. Sometimes it doesn’t work, sometimes I tap it twice to skip a song and it taps three times instead to start the song over. That is very irritating honestly.

RCG7ZYLTG5BG,B09JVG3TWX,4.0 out of 5 stars May not be great for kids,Melissa G,4,"Good for the price, good for what they are designed to do, not so good for other circumstances.Mostly my fault for trying to make it work differently than designed.Tired of cheap knock offs, really wanted to get my kids Amazon branded products to go with our Alexa enabled home.Got two of these on sale for children for Christmas.The semi-in/on ear design does not fit their small ears.Had I read more reviews about how they can be a weird fit, maybe I would have chosen otherwise.Of course from fall Prime Day to Christmas is now past the return window so stuck with two pairs we can't use and can't return.Other cons:Tried to add them to my child's IPad like normal earbuds, not found.Tried to add them to the home Alexa network like an Echo, nope.Figured out I had to connect them to my own mobile phone with the Alexa App first, then pair with child's device... Odd, but ok.(I now have two sets paired with my phone in addition to my real Google Buds, I'm sure that will never cause issues...)Still can't find listed as an Alexa device for the home network, can only control directly from my mobile when Blue Tooth paired.From Alexa Music App, can't cast music to them like all the other Echo devices. It isn't listed.Tried to use the wake up Alexa command to make it play a song (major use for my kids.)After having to go to a room outside earshot of the other Alexa devices in the house, it said something about needing to be paired with a device...So my kids can't use the embedded Alexa functions unless actively paired with MY phone.Only tried a few times, maybe we could figure out the ""Alexa functions"" in time but we gave up pretty quick since they dont fit their ears anyway.They likely work well as a primary headphone for an adult and it's my fault for thinking too highly of these, but they clearly do not work for my kids as designed and now we are stuck with 2 of them.","Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2023",AH4URABGCVG72ZRXE2JDGUPUXJKA,True,3,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device Only

R2OQA77CJCI8WR,B09JVG3TWX,4.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic wireless earbuds for the price!!,wiselyunwise,4,"Loving these since they arrived, been trying out various things. Some features are par for the course and some are really and pleasantly surprising, especially for a device at this price point!! If consumers keep an open mind, could give serious competition to AirPods!!Pros:* Super easy setup. Opened the Alexa app, put Echo Buds in my ear, it detected and did the setup. Good to go in under 60 sec!* Beautiful audio, on par with Apple AirPods 2nd gen!!* Love the equalizer sliding controls in the app. Not preset like AirPods.* Ability to customize 1-2-3 taps and separately for Right and Left buds is fantastic!! Design tip for next generation of Buds to the Echo Buds team:: Touch-slide control for volume up/down along the Buds’ long stick would be awesome! I’ve set up Triple Tap as my volume control right now, a little clunky.* Seamless jumping between 2 devices works smooth n easy, worth it! Good investment of time here, team!* Tight integration with Alexa is great, as before. Long press to activate Alexa is a smart thing too!* Small, simple, colorful packaging. A delight to open!Why I took away one star:* The Echo Buds case is a Fail: — Part of my AirPods’ appeal is the smooth, marble-like feel of the case, makes holding it in your hand almost addictive. While the interior of the Echo Buds case is a shiny smooth black, not sure why they chose a matte finish for the outside. Doesn’t feel good to hold in your hand, will need to put it in my pocket :( — Design reco for the next iteration for the Echo team:: Give 2 hinges for the case’s lid and not one hinge. It removes the sideways play in the lid when closed and dramatically increases the perceived quality of the product. — Another design reco for the case:: There is a little long groove on the body which helps to open the case. It is just not deep enough to quickly open the lid when in a hurry. The case is also horizontally oriented (unlike the AirPods case which is vertically oriented). But the lid on the Buds case is so thin that you almost always need two hands to open the case and access your Buds, can’t do it with one hand. The matte finish also makes it slippery. Given all these issues, I just feel like the design team didn’t do their job when it came to the case which is such an integral part of the experience as Apple has taught us. The case by far is the biggest fail in the Echo Buds if you ask me, it’s got to change.* Didn’t come with a charging cable, which was an interesting choice because this needs a USB-C cable. The Echo Buds case says “made for iPhone | iPad” and that’s what I intend to use it with. But those use their lightning cable, so I don’t really have a way to charge this with right now.

R18NUOG0Y38PZZ,B09JVG3TWX,5.0 out of 5 stars Really Great for the Price,Olandir,5,"I got these when they first came out and I've had them for about a month now. These are the first wireless earbuds I've ever purchased so I didn't know what to expect but so far I'm pleasantly surprised, especially considering how inexpensive they are.I think the sound is great. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch but I can definitely tell that these have much better sound quality than my wired earbuds. My only complaint from a sound standpoint is occasionally there will be interference or it will cut out. I assume this is just par for the course for something that's wireless / bluetooth, but it can be annoying and there have been a couple of times I needed to reconnect them to clear up an audio problem. It doesn't happen enough for it to be a deal breaker though, and it could just be my phone as it never happens with computer audio.As far as Alexa integration, these work great. I barely have to say ""Alexa"" above a whisper for the earbuds to activate, which is great when I'm in public and don't want to appear like I'm talking to myself. It also helps if I don't want to trigger one of my nearby Alexa devices, although even if I do, the proximity awareness of echo devices means that if I have my earbuds in, my other echo's won't pick up the command, which is great.From a comfort standpoint, I think my opinion is going to be subjective, after all, everyone's ears are different. I can keep these earbuds in for up to two hours before I need a break. I don't like to keep the earbuds in when I'm not using them so I keep the case in my pocket and take the earbuds out when I'm not using them. That keep my ears from getting tired.I think the battery life is great. Again, I usually only keep them in my ears for around 2 hours, but there have been a couple of times that I've keep them in for 4 to 5 hours and they've almost run completely out of power. In those cases, 15 to 20 minutes in the case and they are good as new.In addition to all this, I really like the features of these earbuds. They were very easy to setup with the Alexa app. They seamlessly connect to my phone and laptop at the same time and I can listen to audio from either device at any time without having to do any type of manual switching. I can be listening to audio on my laptop and if my phone rings, it will pause whatever is playing on my laptop to give me an opportunity to answer the phone. The tapping gestures are programable and straightforward, and I have the ability to summon both Alexa and Google's Assistant at any time either by voice or by a long-press.All in all, these are great. I'd say 4.5 stars instead of five, but since I can't do half stars, I feel like these are so good that it's better to round up than down. You honestly can't beat these for the price.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2023",AHIZDXIJ65WUBYQMLNR7VJLQ77GA,True,12,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only
R32SAHDDWMXIAW,B09JVG3TWX,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones for $35,Placeholder,4,"To preface this review I searched high and low and semi-in-ear headphones with multipoint connection. I chose these because I felt like if I had issues with them Amazon would be better able to support me than a small company.With that being said, when I bought them they were $35 which to me is a great price for multipoint headphones which allows me to connect to my phone and work laptop at the same time. However because they were on sale I was expecting them to feel like $50 buds which they do not. They feel cheap, I’m talking 5 Below cheap. The plastic they chose for the case and buds is confusing to say the least. Yes it’s light but it feels like if I drop it it’s gonna explode & break.Second is the earbuds. They should really include a video on how to wear them. While the book says they don’t go in your ear it really should say “sit buds in ear” Literally, just sit them, don’t place them. I don’t like in ear cause they are uncomfortable and at first I was worried cause these were as well however once I learned the proper placement I can barely feel em. I will say by sitting them they do feel like they will fall out but I don’t do anything rigorous so I’m not concerned.As a fan of Apple wired buds, I like the sound of these. I was quite surprised by how loud they are and it has an impressive bass. However, when my husband called he sounded mousey which hopefully I can fix.The last thing is the multipoint. When I first connected it, it paused my music when I got a call on my laptop (those calls sound normal) but I accidentally hit play on a song during a call and since, it’s not pausing the music for my work calls which is important to me but being able to use one set of headphones for two devices is more important so I’m gonna keep them.TLDR: Work great, feel cheap, get em on sale","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023",AGPEBDUQKQCXMRFTP5PYNUQADRPA,True,7,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only
R8B857SJGUETS,B09JVG3TWX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Nice, with caveats",Day Light,4,"I own a pair of Echo Buds (2nd Gen) and like them quite a bit. A few things about this new 2023 model intrigued me so I decided to give them a try.I have mixed feelings about these, but am going to keep them and have rated it 4 stars instead of 3, primarily because I LOVE the built-in Alexa support.- The setup was easy, fast and straightforward.- The multipoint device connection works really well. With two devices paired (for me, an iPhone and iPad), it automatically connects to both of them so that I don't have to manually connect depending on which device I'm using. Very cool!- Using only left, only right or both earbuds seems to work flawlessly.- Built-in Alexa support is a game changer and really, really useful!- The case feels a little cheap. I like the look and feel on the outside, but less so the shiny plastic inside and wobbly hinge. And the indent on the front to open it is too shallow, making it difficult to open. A plus is that the case magnets are strong and easily grab the buds for a solid recharging connection.- I find that these fit well as far as sound quality, and are very comfortable — but are NOT secure by any means. A quick shake or tilt of my head and they are often on the floor. I feel comfortable wearing these around the house, but would not use them during a workout or an energetic hike as it is too easy for them to fall out. Perhaps this is a side effect of the semi in-ear, one size fits all design. An update -- I stand by what I wrote, but want to add that using them indoors or in calm outdoor environments works well and they do not readily fall out in normal use. Plus, the ease of putting them on without having to push them into my ear canals and the overall comfort overcomes the negatives -- these are a joy to use.- The sound quality is very good with crisp, clear audio (I mainly use them for listening to audio books and TV). And it is plenty loud enough, although I have to turn it up if I am in a noisy environment.- I have mixed feelings about Amazon not including a USB charging cable. In some ways, this is good as many of us have a ton of these cables and another one is not needed. On the other hand, USB-C is just becoming the norm and I imagine there are users who don't have the right cable and will be upset that they can't charge the device without going out and buying one.- The lack of noise canceling is a non-issue for my needs. The Echo Buds 2nd Gen have good noise canceling and I use it often. I've tried these 2023 buds with air conditioning and outside wind and the sound still comes through clearly.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2023",AFYEOQGISVIE4QMB4DRGQTUWGJTQ,True,74,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

The value was great (I purchased them on Prime day, so they were discounted.)The Alexa feature works well.I have a deformed ear canal as a result of a birth defect/constant ear infections and in-ear headphones with the rubber tips aren't comfortable for me to use. I have to use in-ear headphones with this or the ipod style of buds. These are a comfortable fit, if a little on the larger size. They stay in my ears nicely.I mostly listen to podcasts/audio books and the sound is very good. The limited amount of music I have listened to on them has been a good quality.The biggest drawback I have found, and the reason I just like them, and not love them: I have an iPhone and the connection/notifications isn't great.I don't always get notification sounds. Sometimes I get a ding, sometimes it will tell me I have a text message and from who, but not every time. Sometimes it just keeps playing my podcast with no notification at all and I will notice later that I have a missed call.They lose connection with the iPhone a lot as well, to the point that I have to go into the blue tooth settings and disconnect/reconnect them several times throughout the day. It is annoying, and something to note. I am curious if they have the same issue with an Android phone.Overall I am happy with the product, and for the price would purchase again. In fact, next time the price drops I will be purchasing a set for my husband as a backup.","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2024",AFAIV6E3IMGMS6AXO3OKVAWUBTQA,True,1,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device Only

We did what I've done, but I'm always willing to try and give support a chance.**Updated to 3 stars for the effort, will update once we see how it goes.I love the first gen Echo Buds, thought I would also love these. May return, they were on sale, may not. I'll start by saying I'm in the IT profession and am proficient in troubleshooting a variety of devices, so it's not a user-error on this. I'll also concede that perhaps I have a bad batch - you make 200,000 of something, sometimes a few have issues.Here are my concerns:* Will not stay in your ear if doing much activity (true, this could vary by person). I can sit and read with these and after about 10 minutes, one will fall out (maybe I turned my head, not a lot of movement). I saw this in other reviews, but I generally use these for when I read or do chores, so not a deal-breaker, but it is noticeable.* Fit just isn't great, which means sound is very low. I've used every variation, made sure I had them in right, even tried wearing them wrong to see if they would fit better haha, trust me, I really tried to make these work, I'm stubborn like that.* Does not advertise that it does, so can't blame them, but it does not have noise cancelling (just to share the features if you're used to this on your gen1 buds. Again, not knocking this product for not having this feature since it's not advertised, BUT - if you pair this with overall low volume and bad fit, all outside noises added to that, and they're pretty worthless to use as earphones. I tried to ""fix it"" by turning up the volume to max, max is low, tried to compensate this way but it was a no-go.*Will not stay connected to Alexa with my Android device (tried multiple devices from my S23 to my Kindle, Amazon Tablet, etc.* Will not stay connected for more than 20 minutes (if that) Multiple devices - S23, Ipad, Windows 11 PC, Windows 10 PC.* Will not reconnect. I have to essentially remove it, wipe it off all devices and add it like a new device EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to use it.In summary, after 15 uses, it just sits on my desk now. I haven't given up hope yet, tried all troubleshooting I could find in the comments and online, to no avail.I'm probably just going to wait out a software update to see if it resolves it and maybe let my 6 year old use them.I don't like things going to the landfill so I am hesitant on returning only because of that as I know that is where they'll go from being used.Hopefully this review helps you make a decision. If you have them and love them, tell me why, and maybe I just got a lemon.","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2023",AG3LLMGL45THXN4SACXY7PZ2M7DA,True,14,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

I bought these after I sadly lost one of my Samsung earbuds. My Buds2 were awesome but I can't afford to buy a whole new set at the moment so these were Plan B. Like my older set of Echo Buds, these have amazing sound quality. I was a bit bummed that they didn't have noise cancelling but I can see how that would be hard to achieve with how the manufacturer intended it to fit in your ear (loose and barely in the canal), which is usually highly uncomfortable and bothersome for me but these are surprisingly decent AND actually stay in place for me. I'm surprised at how well I can hear my music while still being able to naturally hear the environment around me, with neither over- or underwhelming each other, if that makes sense.

R1UP06QGC0BA65,B09JVG3TWX,3.0 out of 5 stars Good but has some issues,Bluesnut,3,"I love the sound quality and the way they can connect seamlessly with more than one device at a time. It's also cool to be able to just talk to Alexa anywhere. That being said there are a few things that are not so great. First the fit. I was skeptical to begin with on this type of earbud. I tend to have trouble keeping them in my ears. If I smile, talk, or eat they tend to fall out, so that is what I expected these would do. At first, I was pleasantly surprised that with the little silicone covers they stayed in my ears fairly well. As I wore them longer, they started to get loose and would start to hurt. Secondly Alexa. This might be picky on my part but having to go through Alexa to make a call was awkward. She would get my contacts wrong or not understand what I wanted. But most annoying was the fact that if the internet connection was not just right, she didn't work at all. Siri does a better job than Alexa so I would find myself yelling ""Hey Siri!"" instead of ""Alexa..."" because Siri understood what I wanted most of the time when it came to phone functions. Third is the worst problem. Battery life. I have a pair of cheap earbuds like less than $15 that has ear loops and also can connect to two devices and the battery can last 12-16 hrs playing and standby. I cannot even get 8 out of the Echo Buds. Yes, you have the case to charge them but that doesn't help when you want to listen now. So, you almost need to have two pair of earbuds if you are going to be doing any long-term listening. I work overnights on 10-hour shifts. I need long a lasting battery. In conclusion I do like these, I'm happy I have them, but are they my favorites, no. I would tell people they are nice but just not my favorite.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2024",AHCUO2O7EJHVIJRHRAIQ3VXVRSRA,True,10,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device Only

I am receiving no financial or promotional gain for this. Just want to help y’all out.I have long since been a fan of AirPods. But lately have been frustrated with the lack of innovation and consistently high price tag. I’m always on the lookout for cheaper alternatives. I have had these earbuds for almost a month and these new buds do not disappoint.If you’re like me, then these are what you’ve been looking for! Here’s a quick comparison from my perspective. Note: I’m comparing them to AirPods Gen 2 and Gen 3 as they aren’t trying to compete with AirPods Pro/noise canceling. Also, I’m not a huge fan of those types as they aren’t very comfortable to me. That’s why I’ve always like the design of AirPods/Apple earbudsComfort:Echo buds = AirPods Gen 2Echo buds > AirPods Gen 3Note: APG3 consistently hurt my ears after a couple hours of use. Echo Buds have yet to be uncomfortable after 10+ hours. Plus the EB’s fit and stay in betterBattery:Echo buds > AirPods Gen 2Echo buds > AirPods Gen 3Note: I sleep with mine (one bud at a time) in. I can’t go all night without either gen of AirPods dying. EB’s last all night plus still have ~50% left (I disabled listen for Alexa).Sound quality:Echo buds = AirPods Gen 2Echo buds < AirPods Gen 3Note: EB’s have good sound quality. I mostly use earbuds for music, podcasts, and audio books. APG3 has much better sound for high quality music if you’re looking for that plus spacial audio with movies and tv shows. I rarely use them for that so it’s really a non factor for me.Mic:Echo buds < AirPods Gen 2Echo buds < AirPods Gen 3Note: with phone calls, EB’s are not quite as clear and sound a bit more distant. It’s not a big deal and the listener still hears you fine, just not as clear.Mulitipoint connectivity:Echo buds > AirPods Gen 2Echo buds > AirPods Gen 3Note: Airpods don’t switch between devices seamlessly. EB’s do. In fact, they are the only earbud on the market in the sub $100 range that I’ve seen have it. Pretty impressive.Price:Echo buds - $50AirPods Gen 2 - $100Airpods Gen 3 - $180Other:Touch controls, configuration and other added features are all pretty comparable from what I’ve experienced. I don’t really use these, so they’re a non factor.Conclusion: So far, Echo Buds way outperform AirPods for me. Given they are pretty similar to AirPods Gen 2 and HALF the cost, fit significantly better and are much more comfortable than AirPods Gen 3 for a THIRD of the cost, I have no reason to go back to AirPods.Hope this review is helpful!","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2023",AEMFL7GOTF6UAIHFSFBK2575XP5A,True,29,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

I'm a bit of an audiophile so there's a bit of EQ tweaking that can be done to make it a little better but out of the box it just seems pretty standard. Not terrible at all.Comfort: They are not a one size fits all so I guess be a bit alert when getting these. They kinda grip the inside of your ears fine until you're exercising and sweating and then it's kinda just sliding out of your ear.And the gripes I have: (warning, gonna sound whiny for sure)- Why is the carrying case/charger top flat with a little joke of a divet to sorta not really jam your fingernail in there just to open the case? Literally stub my finger every single time I want to use this (not an exaggeration) because there is no grip and no thoughts about easy access put into this thing.- I get it's an Amazon product but why does it force you to use the Alexa app for everything and then take it further by forcing alexa voice command buttons at the top of your notification bar on your phone so everytime I use this (despite the ""hey Alexa"" being disabled in the settings) there's this annoying extra thing always there cluttering my screen?- The sensitivity for the ""button presses"" are so nuts I actually disabled them all and had to reconfigure them. I've had Galaxy buds for years, JBL earbuds and even some off brand things, I have never had an issue where I take an earbud out of my ear and despite it no longer being in my ear it's still fully controlling my music or activating voice commands. When it comes out the ear it should be disconnected until I put it back in and these just don't do that.- On that same subject for anyone still reading, go into the settings and turn all of the button presses off. Set any commands like play/pause and next song to be on double tap or triple tap. This while save you the anerysm.- Last gripe I have and this is after meticulously checking to make sure it's not an application thing controlling this but when you take an earbud out to listen to only one ear, it should auto switch to monostereo mode. Again, I have bought cheap Noname $20 earbuds that do this, I assumed it was a no-brainer feature that all earbuds have and now I miss it. If you don't actively go into each app (assuming there is a feature to toggle this in the app) and swap to mono you will get situations where depending on the earbud you can hear the voice singing but not the accompanying guitar or other instrument. Dumb. Really dumb.Overall thats why I have it a 3. Sound quality carried it and then it's just riddled with odd inconveniences.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2023",AHWQAMOF2BC2P5PCI5YZU7M3AUTA,True,16,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

First, the earbuds come precharged to get you setup via the Alex app. I have an iPhone 13 pro and it took me less than 5 minutes to setup and it was simple. I work in an office environment and typically use one ear bud at a time. With that said, I am able to get through 8-10 hour day on the same charge and still have fully charged case. I've had no issues with making or receiving phone calls. These are not noise cancelling which I wanted and hence being perfect for a collaborative office environment. Its nice to be able to enjoy your type of music or podcast having it playing as if it was in the background and still able to hold a conversation or hear someone call your name. I've read several complaints about fitment but if you have used any apple earbuds then these should fit and feel fine. I have never had an issue with any earbud brand with fitment. In my opinion for open ear earbuds the sound quality is good. There is an option in the app to finer tune them to your liking but I've yet to do that. For the price point you can't go wrong. Plus, there is a ton of integration features with Alexa if you're into that.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AHVZPEGR66NU2LOHU5PLAKF6WTYQ,True,0,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only
R1A7HL5G81C66A,B09JVG3TWX,3.0 out of 5 stars A Month Review,James Resendez,3,"(This ‘test’ was conducted for iOS, so it may or may not be the same for Android users)A cheaper alternative to the infamous Airpods. There is so much to like and dislike about this one in particular. The style itself is pretty neat itself just like a tiny box, problem with it is that it opens too easily. The magnetic feature is always gonna have this and in the future someone may design a case with a lock but standard case is something to be kinda careful about it being randomly opened and maybe losing an earbud. The earbuds themselves are okayish at best. They get the job done and the sound quality compared to most other wireless earbuds is actually very good! The problem is how easily they can fall out of the ears which also present another problem. The earbuds have touch on the flat part of it which is nice because you wanna do somethings that don’t require you to open your phone, however, the idea is that you tap the side for its basic options (ex: Answer Calls, Play, Skip, etc.) but the killer here is the built in Alexa which yea its nice to have because Alexa on the go is pretty nice but like, so is a lot of other things your phone already has. Alexa is tap and hold to activate it so it listens. So if you rest your hand (or sometimes other objects) on that earbud you will constantly have to cancel it or respond to it. Honestly it would have been nicer of it being 4 taps to activate instead of press and hold. Finally the connection between both earbuds will often glitch a moment before tuning itself to the first earbud you put on, its a minor thing really but just had to point that out as well.The battery life on the case is amazing and the earbud alone can go for 4-5 hours which is really good for the price. Can do most of my things without having a problem to recharge so much. Inside of a car during a heatwave a lot of phones or anything technical will have problems and fail to work after, this one didn’t have any problem and still continued to work after! (Do not put in direct sunlight for long periods of time, this happened inside of a car with temperatures going 115 degrees.)Final Thoughts:Honestly I wouldn’t say it can compare to something like airpods because of the fact that the airpods were literally designed for iphone usage, but for a cheaper alternative these work pretty great! I got them near the start where there is hardly no such thing as a case to protect it but it does pretty alright on its own. Some connectivity issues every now and then but its pretty nice for budget wireless earphones. So unless you don’t wanna spend a pretty penny for airpods these are the next best thing!","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2023",AFNOQ2EJOAIM2ENQHIGFL2VKAFTA,True,2,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device Only

I can't handle the in-ear sound canceling ones and my Soundpeats would fall out from time to time.These Echo Buds are a good compromise, with the silicone covers providing a decently snug fit. I don't exercise with these, so your experience may vary if you are moving vigorously, but they work pretty well for day-to-day use.Pros:- Battery use is excellent IF you disable the Alexa capabilities (more on that later). I get 6+ hours per earbud listening to mostly podcasts.- Sound is good (although I am not an audiophile and mostly just listen to podcasts).- Touch controls work pretty well and you can customize them in the Alexa app.Cons:- You have to install the Alexa app to set these up. Initially, I was pleased with how responsive Alexa is for voice control and it was nice to be able to see battery levels for the earbuds in the app (although they weren't always accurate). However, I soon discovered that the Alexa app is a battery drain and will force itself into ""unrestricted"" battery mode on my Pixel 7. Fortunately, you CAN use these earbuds without the app installed, you'll just lose Alexa integration. Normal touch controls for your media will still function.- I often wish they were louder. I'm not sure if it's just the way they sit in my ears or my phone's audio settings but I find myself constantly needing to turn the volume up (I do work in a noisy environment).- The case gets scratched and scuffed pretty quick (wish it came in black) and the indent to open it is very shallow and tricky to find with your finger in a hurry.Overall, these are a good set of earbuds for the price.

Maybe I should actually READ the little booklet 🤔 Imagine what I might learn.I was surprised at all the picky reviews how they don't do this or my other 5 pairs can do this...Pffffft. You want them to do MORE?!?!?I mean, the sound is amazing, crisp amd crystal clear. I haven't even adjusted anything. It's fine to me the way it is.As far as the fit, this is the reason I'm leaving a review. They sort of sit in my ears, feeling a little loose, but in no way are they loose. It's hard to describe. Once I do get them placed correctly, they feel like they were custom fitted.They do NOT fall out.Not even thru all my gardening and landscaping tantrums and weed tearing and paver tossing. And they do not hurt. In all my years everything has hurt my ears or at least been too annoying to use.I have problems with the crystals in my ears and equilibrium, so I'm reluctant to stick things in there.These ECHO buds are a dream come true.They are comfortable and sound awesome, while still allowing for light ambient awareness.

R3PUH3PLIF1L3C,B09JVG3TWX,4.0 out of 5 stars Great if you use Alexa a lot and these earbuds fit your ears,Insead,4,"I am a big Alexa fun and when my Echo frames died a couple months ago I was looking for their replacement and found these earbuds. When they earbuds arrived I was really impressed how easy it was to communicate with Alexa - they are really hands-free, as advertised.Unfortunately, there was one big problem - the earbuds did not stay in my ears for long. No matter, how I would try them - with or without earbud covers, even upside down - they would not stay in my ears. I almost returned them back, but then I found a satisfactory solution - using an elastic ribbon to keep them staying in my ears. You can use aesthetically better looking and professionally made earbud hooks, but elastics worked for me just fine (see the picture).So, here is a summary of what I liked and did not like:I love their perfect integration with AlexaI like that I can choose using only one earbud (left or right - does not matter) or bothThere is not active noise canceling or good sound insulation, but I would even consider it as a plus - I can hear when somebody is talking to me. I can still make decent phone calls and listen to podcasts on relatively noisy streets - the sound is much better than with echo frames! I guess it's a matter of personal taste and intended use.What I did not like - a very poor fit, at least for my ears. Ergonomically something should be done for earbuds design or accessories like hooks or wings should be included.The sound quality is decent for podcasts, and most of time I would use only one earbud, but when I use both earbuds sometimes there is a very short, but still noticeable sound delay between two sides.Bluetooth range seems to be shorter than for my older earbuds, but it is still reasonable.","Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2023",AHJWL5XU3VLYECN3TXJFF5Y2XR5Q,True,35,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

The auto pausing is an advertised feature and playback resumes just fine on a phone but not on a laptop, I've had to disconnect them while on video calls because triggering the auto pause feature just leaves me with no audio until I reconnect them. The laptop in question is a Chromebook.- Removing both earbuds basically disconnects them from my phone while using Spotify, it takes around 10 seconds for them to reconnect once I put them back again which is annoying and has lead to situations where I've hit play and the music just blasts through my phone's speakers because they haven't reconnected yet. All this happens while they're outside the case but just not on my ears.Having some feature to turn off the proximity sensors would fix this issues in my opinion and make the experience a lot better.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AGDS3GWYYDKMJUTVVTCYWXEGDQBQ,True,1,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

I was hearing Dolby cinematic sounds coming from all directions, filling my ears with astonishing clarity, richness, detail, and depth. I even startled myself a few times after forgetting they were in my ear and I pushed play on a video on my social media feed. Anyway, I love the Alexa integration, however I'm finding a few things I need to tweak, like when setting alarms to wake me up, it sets automatically to the phone and not to my EchoShow where I need it. If it sets to the phone I need to be waring my buds to get the audio alarm. I wish the buds delivered a bit more bass. The bass quality isn't bad, but you will quickly adjust to it. Sometimes the inner speakers will rattle, which can be distracting. These are isolated occurances, not necessarily a constant issue with the buds themselves. These buds are super easy to pair. They even have a ""find my"" feature, in case you lose a bud or your set somewhere. The only 1 con that I have, is the design/fit! I love a bud that fits into the ear and suctions snug. These Echo's barely sit on/in the ear so I have to keep adjusting. I am investing in an ear hook accessory to help with that bcse I am certainly keeping these buds! Last, I have finally found buds that people can ""HEAR ME"" crystal clear! I usually sound far away or muffled and just not crisp. Two people I talk to most said they hear me perfectly, even when I whispered! I was sold! I saw these buds offered with and without a charger. I chose without cause it was cheaper of course, as I have USB-C chargers already. OH, and the case even works as a power bank for the buds, giving them 3 additional full charges before you need to charge the case again. That is super helpful as all my other devices live on charges all day every day. I highly recommend these Echo buds. If you don't already use Alexa and its features, these buds and the Alexa app will change your life and productivity.

The bass and mids are clear, and highs are crisp – delivering a well-balanced audio experience., making my favorite music and podcasts even more enjoyable.Comfort is key for me during long listening sessions, and it definitely too my ears some time to adjust.

The audio quality is great for the price, battery life is ok with about 6hrs out of each earbuds, the alexa app and alexa in ear functionality is as good as any Amazon echo when it works and it's even sweat resistant. My main gripe with these is any amazon app has terrible reliability with the buds, I've had music refusing to start again after almost any interruptions, the app only playing one song of a playlist (shuffle is turned on), to alexa straight up refusing to do anything! It's ridiculous, this shouldn't be a problem from a company that has reliable software already.

Kohler,4,"I had a few requirements for wireless earbuds that make me kind of picky for this type of product.They had to be solid construction (no rubber tips that come off)They had to have at least 2ish hours of batteryI wanted to get them in something other than whiteI love em. Ordered them while on vacation in Florida and used them just about every day. The case is very compact and they snap in so easily, you can put them away in the dark if you had to. They are slightly bigger than the Apple Earpods I was using before, so they get a little uncomfortable after an hour+, but this is lessened when removing the stretchy rubber covers they come with. I like my earbuds to be just a hair loose so they are comfy for long periods. They do very easily switch between devices on the fly once you have them paired, so there's no hassle trying to connect every time. (I'm new to bluetooth headphones so I was somewhat concerned about this) The finger sense tapping feature is fully customizable, though it really doesn't register with my fingers, so I turned it mostly off. One tap to pause/unpause is fine for me.They absolutely do require the Alexa app to start using, so don't think you can get away with just trying to pair them and go. The app had a ton of annoying questions when I first installed it, but it shows me the battery percentage for each bud and the case.Word of warning though: The app pretty much requires ""your location"" all the time, not just when using the app, so if you don't want Alexa knowing where you are 24/7, you may want to keep looking at other options.That being said, these are an absolutely steal of a deal when they launched near the time of this review, June 2023.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2023",AE2ZWL256OUZLCU5YYSVUDYLNR4Q,True,8,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

Pairing the Echo buds with my phone and other devices was easy. I like that it can pair to multiple devices easily, unlike some of my other headphones and earphones. With my other headphones, I have to manually unpair one device to use it with the other device. But with the Echo buds, I don't have to do that.The sound on these Echo buds is just right.

Apple Airpods 3rd gen (also tipless) have a sophisticated microphone feedback system to adapt sound to your ear canal shape and leakage, so they rule the roost in terms of sheer sound quality.HOWEVER these new Echo Buds non-ANC have a huge mechanical improvement, the already installed thin silicone slip on covers for the hard plastic body. These go a long way to keeping the earbuds in place. At the same time, it's not an airtight seal so that* There's less ear fatigue and feeling of bloat in the ear canal, and* We can still hear our surroundings. With silicone tips I not only have to stop my music or video, I have to remove one silicone tipped earbuds to hear my family, but with these I can pause but leave them in place.These are ideal for Zoom calls. I don't like the total isolation that conventional silicone tips create. On the other hand, Apple Airpods which also let in the ambient sound are too slippery and keep falling out.These will pair with two devices saving re-pairing each time you move from phone to tablet or laptop.I don't know what sound quality level CODEC Amazon uses here. For the time we should assume SBC although Apple's use AAC for better quality. Android remains stubbornly unable to use AAC well but works fine with these so I suspect default is SBC.I am not a critical listener, but I'd rate sound quality with these high on my Pixel - musical, solid but honest bass, good midrange and top end. Balanced. For extended videos I prefer these vs silicone tips which seal the ear canal but are more fatiguing. Airpods Pro 2nd Gen which also lack silicone tips continue to blow almost everything else in the market away, while Studio Beats Plus and Pixel Buds dominate entry level.For the current sale price of $35 these are a steal.(These prefer Alexa as your personal assistant, if you use voice commands, and probably don't place nice with Siri or Hey Google.)","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2023",AE7P6HRZSF2LA5WAOZDKZVWBNPMQ,True,5,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

R28ZCO6RZQGYKI,B09JVG3TWX,5.0 out of 5 stars Survivors,MichelleU,5,"I got these earbuds for my 17 yo son for Christmas. He loved them and said they were very nice.The next day, he was outside with the dog and dropped one of them into like 2 feet of snow.We all searched into the night and throughout the next several weeks periodically and could *not* find it. Lots of tears from my son- he felt really bad about this. The ‘find it’ feature worked but not good enough to pinpoint it within the place in the yard where it was at.Anyways, so it took a month for all the snow to melt and in that time, we had had more snow, ice, rain, and temps well into the negative double digits (-20 at one point). We were 100% certain that the missing earbud was gone forever even if we / when we did find it. After all, the packaging says ‘water resistant’, not water proof, and nothing about being able to freeze them.I found the missing earbud in the very wet grass two days ago. It looks a little more worn than the other. We dried it out, then put it on the charger and figured we would at least give it a chance.IT WORKS PERFECTLY. Holds the same battery charge life as the other one (so far), and sounds exactly the same. My son reports that he loves the sound, loves Alexa (he can tell her to pause, start, stop music and it’s awesome) and it has adjustable settings for bass/treble etc. He also has told me that he can still hear out of his ears with these in.These little earbuds are quality, rugged survivors. Highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2024",AF7MXJTQGQ7SPLJZCJUMIYXYGVQA,True,8,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

Which is surprising since this was a fraction of the cost. It blows every other $50 TWS set of earbuds out of the water at its price range. These earbuds do not have ANC, but you can do a custom EQ profile with the Amazon Alexa app. But, the default tuning should be fine.-1 Star - Amazon Alexa App REQUIREDI guess this was the kicker. The string that was attached. You NEED the Amazon Alexa app on your phone to activate and pair new devices. It will keep a list of your paired devices and it will also access your phone's location via the Amazon Alexa App. And Alexa is listening to you by default if you do not turn it off. You will also not be able to pair any devices without the app. So it is a privacy concern, but also the app is very VERY SLOW. Like okay, collect my data, but at least load up faster!!!Anyways, tl;dr - BEST-sounding TWS Earbuds under $50, but it will collect your data through the Amazon Alexa app.","Reviewed in the United States October 20, 2023",AEKTKAMJBIB3P5F2E44VCTH3PVJA,True,1,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only
R215QX9RPG4ZWY,B09JVG3TWX,3.0 out of 5 stars I miss the Auto Noise Cancelation I've had in other Echo Buds,rickyd172,3,"Was so disappointed to find out this new version of Amazon Echo Buds does not feature ANC like my numerous other Echo Buds have. I am glad that they still do have microphones in both earbud, so you can use it for calls with either earbud in your ear and the other earbud in the case like the previous edition has.Buds also do not feel as comfortable in the ear as my last few sets, This fact is probably due to not having the adjustable fit ear pieces that previous Echo Buds have had. I am probably going to continue using my old 2021 set instead of this new 2023 edition. The fit of the new ones just bugs me too much. I may keep them in my backpack for a spare set in case I forget my 2021 sets, as I already have a pair of them I carry in my pocket and a backup set of 2021 ones I keep in my vehicle's center consol.As a major Alexa device user (I currently have 22 Echo Devices and 11 Blink Cameras as I type this post) I have to say I am disappointed with this new version. I really hoped that I would be able to give this a 5 star rating, but the downgrade from my current Echo Buds is unacceptable.The picture is allow possible purchasers to see the difference in the buds from the old version. Not having the adjustable fit is bad enough, but no longer being noise canceling means I probably will not be using them.","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AGLJTPBFDE67NQ6HYGMNRHTYT22Q,True,3,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

I find them confortable and they stay in better than I would have thoughtThey can connect to both my phone and laptop at the same time which is very useful. Update- they can’t. They keep dropping both at random times. Being connected to two sources makes this happen a lot more.CONS:They eat battery super fastConnection sometimes goes off and only one bud gets soundYou control these through the Alexa app which is fine, but its controls are buried in that app. I have to sift through tons of stuff I dont care about to get the latest battery level.

These earbuds have elevated my daily audio experience, and here's why I couldn't be happier with their performance, especially in conjunction with my iPhone:**Effortless iPhone Pairing (5/5):** Setting up the Echo Buds with my iPhone was a breeze. The pairing process was intuitive and hassle-free, taking just seconds to establish a rock-solid connection. The simplicity of this setup process was a pleasant surprise.**Alexa Integration (5/5):** Having Alexa at my beck and call directly through the Echo Buds has added a layer of convenience to my daily routine. I can effortlessly control smart home devices, check the weather, or get answers to questions, all without taking my phone out of my pocket.**Crystal-Clear Sound (5/5):** The sound quality of the Echo Buds is top-notch. The audio is clear, well-balanced, and offers an immersive listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying music, podcasts, or taking calls, the sound quality has consistently impressed me.**Secure and Comfortable Fit (5/5):** The semi-in-ear design ensures a secure fit that remains comfortable even during extended listening sessions. The earbuds stay in place, and the customizable ear tips ensure a snug fit tailored to my preference.**Intuitive Touch Controls (5/5):** Navigating music, calls, and accessing Siri or Alexa is a breeze with the touch controls on the Echo Buds. They respond accurately and promptly, adding to the overall user-friendliness of these earbuds.**Noise Cancellation (5/5):** The active noise cancellation feature is highly effective in drowning out ambient noise, allowing me to focus on my music or calls without distraction. It's a feature that I've come to appreciate in various settings.In conclusion, the All-new Echo Buds have made a significant impact on my audio experience, especially when paired with my iPhone. The effortless pairing, Alexa integration, crystal-clear sound, secure fit, intuitive controls, and noise cancellation have made these earbuds an indispensable part of my daily life. If you're an iPhone user seeking true wireless earbuds, I highly recommend the All-new Echo Buds.

I have Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 ($370+), but I wasn't comfortable wearing such a high-dollar item while on the job. Enter the 2023 Echo Buds! At Prime Day's $35, this was a risk I was willing to take and I'm glad I did! Even at $50, this is an incredible deal.Once connected (which was a piece of cake), they just WORK. There was no learning curve, no fighting. They do what they're designed to do and they do it well! While I'm working, the Alexa voice commands work flawlessly when my hands are busy; and when I have a spare hand, the touch controls work the first time, every time. I don't know how the science and engineering work, but the Amazon Team outdid themselves, for sure! The Echo Buds hear me every time and the sound of my music is robust and clear. I should have known they work with phone calls, but the first time I answered a call with these, I felt like I'd stepped into the future!I am used to the Noice Cancelling feature of the Bose headphones, so I was worried that the Echo Buds didn't have it and it would be a lesser experience, but I've found that it's far better built as-is! My Bose is for in-home experiences where I don't have to be as aware of my surroundings, so these Echo Buds are perfect for working out and about, especially with coworkers. Don't buy these thinking you'll be getting the purest sound, but don't worry about being tinny or low-quality.Battery life has been incredible! The case charges the buds and combined, they all easily last the work day. I would say the case might be the weakest point, as it's a bit too slick at times and not easy to open with a single hand. I should invest in a silicone case, since being in my pocket has already scuffed the white exterior.Quiet honestly, I think these are underpriced and Amazon doesn't realize just how good these earbuds truly are!","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2023",AGZNYFMCS44C3MJWGUEZ5CRJHX7Q,True,2,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

I'm perfectly happy with the wireless part, but honestly, nothing is small enough to be comfortable in my little ears. Changing out eartips just doesn't do the trick -- they're still not small enough.I had hopes that these might be more comfortable, since they're designed to NOT fit tightly. Unfortunately, they're just uncomfortable in a different way. (During and after wear, my tragus hurts.) These have a removeable plastic cover for a bit of resizing, but IMO, the change seems minimal. These are still too big for my poor ears. For those in the minority like me, these aren't the droids you're looking for.Points to the seller for posting the exact measurements for 2 dimensions. If they fit like other earbuds, or if more earbuds posted exact sizes like that, I may have been able to determine the fit without purchase. Not their fault there was nothing to compare with.Other than the size issue, the ""You must install an app to use these earbuds"" was a bit annoying. Everything else, the sound, the pairing with Android, all seemed great for the price I paid. They absolutely stayed in place while I was active, but ... like I said, they are too big, which probably helped hold them in place.** Edit 20 Feb 2024 **Just gonna point out, I still choose these over my other earbuds most days.

I didn't want to spend much on earbuds I rarely use so they're a fine price for that. They connect to all my devices really easily and ""just work"" which is convenient.I have no idea who has ears this shape. They don't fit inside your ear at all, just kind of sit in it. The left one is super loose and I don't think you could go for a run with it in. The right one fits snugly but starts to hurt after 10 minutes, so I have to angle it to where it's loose to be comfortable.The touch controls should be cool but they're honestly infuriating. Because they are so loose, i adjust them all the time which causes my music/video to pause. It auto pauses media when you take out an earbud, and if you tap it once it pauses. These would be nice features if I didn't have to keep shoving them back in my ears.The sound is good. It's not tinny or anything but doesn't really have any bass. Just ok. The microphone is functional but I have been told I sound very tinny and my friends don't like it.I don't use Alexa at all. I guess if that's something you use often, it would be useful.

So if your at your cubicle or work desk and need some inexpensive headphones, these are for you. The annoying part will just be having to pick them up after they fall out.It’s not ideal for any type of movement activities.

When I run with them, I’m basically spending the whole time holding them in my ears so they won’t fall out.Fast forward to today…. welp, I don’t use them often anymore but I was using it while in the restroom… not fell right out into the toilet bowl. . .

RISRCMBWS3ZC1,B09JVG3TWX,3.0 out of 5 stars I loved these earbuds at first!!!!,Tob,3,I purchases the earbuds in November of 2023. I loved everything about them so much so I purchased another set in December 2023. The sound was good the battery life everything was good. So I March of this year I noticed that the battery life was not lasting as long as it was doing. I had the app on my phone and everytime I would check my battery percentage out it never said anything for the right one. And then there was no sound in the right ear at all. I tried to look up what to do for this and I couldn't get it to work! So I decided to use the new ones I purchased. They worked very well. Then about 2 weeks later the right one went out in this pair also. Anyone have this problem or know what to do to fix this issue?,"Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2024",AENF4ZH44SHD5NJAMZIUSNNQU6LQ,True,1,Color: BlackConfiguration: Device Only

In terms of sound quality these offer quite decent performance for the price category if u can get them on sale probably one the best under $40 with open ear design.Alexa always there in ear is also cool.Unfortunately that alone was not enough to win me over … I been in market for best open ear style under $100 and these fell short if couple places.1. Cheap feel of the charging case compared to the ear buds (they don’t feel like they could sustain any impact)2. More durable finish on case as would be nice I tried to show in pictures but only uses them twice and that was the amount of surface wear from just going in and out of pocket also that color I can only imagine how much dye and dirt it will attract.3. Experience some minor connection issues with sound chopping out and random skips here and there . Happened 2x on two times I used them intensively .Positives .1. Fit worked pretty well for my ear shape able to keep I for 3hr+ no discomfort though the length of the sticks can be bothersome2. Sounds ready good in the price range (there’s definitely better but few under $50 that offer relatively accurate sounds)3.

R3AV2Z04RR5Z97,B0BB5VBFRF,"5.0 out of 5 stars Finally, the perfect buds for me!",BB,5,"Update 04/27/24: These little guys are tough as nails, they just keep getting better!! They ended up in my washing machine because I'm dumb, but the buds still worked perfectly fine when I took them out! The case needed a few hours before it would hold a charge again, but it's back to normal operation. Thank you Sony, this ADHDer was saved from having to spend more on a new pair! 🙌🏾Also, I recall seeing some other reviews say these buds can't be used separately, but I've used just the right one with the left still in the case with no issues. Your mileage may vary, I guess-------I don't leave reviews unless I'm truly blown away by a product and I know these LinkBuds are the best I've had, and I've only been using them for a few minutes! In the past three years, I have gone through Jabra Elite 75t -> Soundcore A40 -> Soundcore Sport X10. Here is where they fell short for me:- The Elite 75t was pretty good imo, the battery just aged out of use and it started having a lot of connectivity issues- The A40 sound was muffled and terrible, the noise canceling was a joke, and it would not stay in my ears unless I pushed the buds in super deep, which made them unpleasant to wear for an extended period- The Sport X10 fixed the issue of having my buds fall out and the sound was really good, but they pushed on my crus of helix if they weren't constantly adjusted, and now I have a discolored mark on that part of my ear that's sensitive to the touch. Yippee... The battery was also super weak, I felt like I had to charge the buds almost every night to get just three hours out of them.The LinkBuds have everything I was looking for, and then some!+ They look large, but they are a perfect fit for my small ears! I didn't even have to swap out the cups. I can shake my head and it doesn't feel like they'll just fly out. Very snug and comfortably seated (and no pressure on my crus of helix, anymore!)+ The control sensors are perfectly calibrated and responsive. I usually prefer buttons because sensors can be finicky (Looking at you, Soundcore...), but the amount of pressure and presses needed for the earbuds to respond feels very natural and consistent.+ The EQ customization is versatile and very easy to set up. The default profile sounded kind of underwhelming, but after calibrating it to my preferred settings, it's hard to want to stop playing my tunes!+ The noise canceling is phenomenal, I truly can't hear anything but my own thoughts when it's activated. Switching to ambient noise is very smooth too.+ Speak-to-chat is a feature I've long missed having on my audio devices, so it was a pleasant surprise to see that option on the app.Overall, I have zero complaints thus far and I hope to use the LinkBuds for a long time :)","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2024",AH7WNIY6WWU4TYDQ7Q5HLSY6SH4Q,True,29,Color: Black
R11XKM5NH30ZUQ,B0BB5VBFRF,5.0 out of 5 stars The best true wireless earphones for everyone,James,5,"The Sony Linkbuds S are a shrunk-down, improved version of the already excellent WF-1000XM4. I wasn't expecting this. Given the ""Linkbuds"" moniker I was expecting them to prioritize ambient sound features over all else, just like the original Linkbuds, but that simply isn't the case here.Build: the Linkbuds S are impossibly small compared to the WF-1000XM4, Sony's previous noise canceling earphones. They actually resemble the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 in overall size and shape. They also sport a nice large touch sensitive area that no one should have trouble missing. The only gripe I do have is that the outer surface is textured and this can cause some discomfort if it rubs against the crus helix.Case: the case is definitely one of the more pocketable out there. It's about the same size as the Airpods Pro case, but slightly shorter and narrower, albeit a bit thicker. However, it also has a textured surface which can make it a little difficult to slide in and out of pockets.Fit: the Linkbuds S fit very similar to the Galaxy Buds 2 and deeper than the WF-1000XM4. They are a little fiddly to fit. In my case I have to rotate them back and forth to get them to seat correctly. Although Sony instructs users to rotate the buds backwards to get a good fit I actually found this uncomfortable because the buds would rub against my Crus Helix and cause discomfort. Rotating them forward slightly fixed the issue. Once the buds were in place I found the fit to be secure and that, combined with their light weight, meant that it was easy to forget they were there. My one complaint about the fit is that the buds are so small that it's very difficult to insert them without either accidentally hitting the touch area or rubbing a finger against the noise canceling microphone, resulting in some static noise.Noise canceling: the noise canceling on the Linkbuds S is fantastic. Although the Linkbuds S are advertised as being open I actually found them to be more isolating than the WF-1000XM4s without noise canceling on. With noise canceling on I actually found the Linkbuds S to be slightly superior to the WF-1000XM4 in terms of blocking out background noise and they certainly blow the Galaxy Buds Pro/2 out of the water. I haven't had chance to test the Linkbuds S with very low frequency sounds (e.g. public transport, planes) but for blocking out office and household noise they're the best true wireless earphones I've tried.Sound: I saved the best to last. I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality of the Linkbuds S. The WF-1000XM4s were a big disappointment in this regard, with an overly dark presentation for my taste that led to recessed mids and lackluster treble. The Linkbuds S by comparison adopt a Harman-like tuning that presents mids and treble brilliantly with a satisfying bass boost that doesn't dominate the overall sound. The Linkbuds S definitely beat the WF-1000XM4s for overall sound and they're up there with the Galaxy Buds Pro/2, which are the reigning champs. Comparing the Galaxy Buds side by side with the Linkbuds S I honestly can't pick a favorite amongst the three, which I think is a very good thing.Other: in my limited tests the transparency features are great, as with the WF-1000XM4s. The only other thing that I think is worth noting is that the Linkbuds S struggle to maintain LDAC connectivity more than the WF-1000XM4s. This isn't surprising, given the small size, but is worth considering for anyone who wants to use LDAC in challenging environments or on the go.Wrap up: previously if I wanted to recommend a pair of true wireless earphones for someone I would have to include a 'but'. The Airpods Pro have great noise canceling but the sound isn't top tier and they don't play well with Android devices. The Galaxy Buds sound fantastic but the noise canceling isn't great and they don't play well with iOS. The WF-1000XM4s have top tier noise canceling and work well with both iOS and Android devices, but their sound isn't the best. The Linkbuds S on the other hand have top tier noise canceling, work excellent with both iOS and Android, and have excellent sound. These are now my default recommendation to anyone looking for new True Wireless earphones.Alternative picks: If it wasn't for the better Bluetooth connectivity of the WF-1000XM4s and the improved battery life the Linkbuds S would have made the XM4s redundant. Whether the increased price is worth it for those things will be up to the individual. I think there's still a case to be made for getting the cheaper Galaxy buds over the Linkbuds S if noise canceling isn't a priority. However, I think the only reason to pay more for the Airpods Pro would be if you really like the design and/or the enhanced integration with iOS is really important.","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2022",AH6VAXGHQYGPVVIMRNEKENKN7ISQ,True,247,Color: Black
R35IMA9TKB4906,B0BB5VBFRF,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good at everything, but probably not the best option currently",C,4,"(This is a lengthy review, so in case you are short on time I have included a quick Pros/Cons summary at the top. This gives an idea of my overall opinions, but for more details continue to read on below.)(Note- I will mostly be comparing these to other earbuds that I have used and/or reviewed recently: AirPods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II )THE GOOD:--Comfort/Fit: So far, these are very comfortable to wear. They are slightly smaller than some of the other earbuds I've tested, and are up there with Airpods Pro in terms of comfort. They also feel very secure in the ear, unlike some other brands. No complaints here with comfort/design.--Mic Quality: The mic quality of these is excellent. I tested out with calling friends, and these were either 1st or 2nd best sounding earbuds according to the people I called. My friend says that these mics are the best out the earbuds we tested in this range.--Multiple Ecosystem Support: These work well with all ecosystems, whether you are using Apple or Android; and with assistants including Alexa and Google.--Good ANC : The noise canceling on these is also fantastic. This technology has come a long way, and sometimes it can be hard to compare ANC, since each company produces earbuds that prioritize blocking out slightly different frequencies. To me these seem like they are close to the best , but maybe the XM4s and Airpods Pro are SLIGHTLY better, especially the XM4s at low frequency ranges. The Adaptive Sound Control is a neat feature that can change ambient sound settings based on your location, though I'm not sure how useful this will be in practice.THE BAD:--Overall Sound Comparison: With the default EQ settings, the overall sound quality actually seems slightly worse than the WF1000XM4s to me. I also prefer the sound of the Klipsch T5 IIs with most music, and even the Galaxy Pros with some songs; as these LinkBuds S can sometimes sound slightly muffled or dampened in comparison. Still good quality sound overall, just not as good as some of the other options in this range, and not my favorite with any type of music I tested.--No Wireless Charging: This seems like a big disappointment for this price range. I would expect that ALL earbuds that are over $200 should have wireless charging at this point.MORE DETAILS:Here are my thoughts on each category, again mostly comparing to: Airpods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II. (I also enlisted the help of a friend of mine that is an Audio Engineer, to give his opinions and to use some of his equipment.)Sound - These sounded great to me when I first put them in and listened to a variety of music. I was not disappointed in overall sound quality at all, and if you aren't comparing these to anything else, you will also probably think that they sound great. It was only after rigorously measuring their output with my friend's mics, and also repeatedly comparing them to all of the other earbuds, that I was able to notice the slightly muffled sound compared to the other earbuds. The Airpods Pro, Klipsch T5 II, XM4, and Galaxy Pro all seem slightly more “clear”, with a broader range. The midrange on the Airpods Pro might be the biggest difference here, and when I switched back and forth between them I felt like I was missing some of those midrange frequencies with the LinkBuds S. Overall sound range/EQ preferences are of course very subjective and personal, but my friend and I both agree that these are definitively not our favorite in this category.Design/Fit – I like the way that these fit in my ear, and they are right up there at the top with Airpods and Klipsch in terms of being lightweight and comfortable. For me, the Galaxy Pros were a little to clunky and felt like they might fall out sometimes, but the LinkBuds S fit great while also feeling secure. The texture of the buds themselves is almost a little scratchy, which took me a little while to get used to, but I think I prefer this texture for touch sensitivity. For me though, I have always preferred the press-able buttons on the Klipsch T5 IIs over all of these touch sensors, partly because I often wear a headband over the earbuds and a sweaty headband can mess with the touch sensors sometimes.Calls – This is probably the best overall feature of these earbuds. The microphone quality seemed to be the best out of all the earbuds when testing out on my friend's equipment, and in real-world testing I experienced similar results. These were either the best sounding, or a close second best when compared to other earbuds when making calls. These sounded the best in almost every environment, maybe tied for best with Klipsch in noisy/windy environments.Water Resistance - These have the same IPX4 rating as most of the other earbuds, but note that the Galaxy Buds Pro have a superior IPX7 rating, if that matters to you. So far these have been working great for exercise, but again personally I prefer more headband-friendly designs sometimes.Charging/etc: These charge at about the same speed as the other earbuds, and have a similar battery life. The BIG difference is that these don't support wireless charging, which seems odd at this price range. These come with a short 9 inch usb-A to usb-C cable in the box, no plug/brick. This is my least favorite in terms of charging options compared to the other earbuds in this price range.OVERALL: These are solid earbuds that feel great, produce good sound, have good ANC, and have excellent microphones for great call quality. They do just about everything well, but at this current price I can't say that they are my favorite, or even the best value. Overall my favorites are probably still the Klipsch T5 IIs, which are currently less expensive than these LinkBuds S earbuds at the time I'm writing this. My second favorite would either be the Galaxy Pros or the Airpod Pros, both of which are slightly less expensive and produce slightly better sound in my opinion. The only thing these LinkBuds S are the best at seems to be the mic/call quality, but even then the difference there isn't big enough for me to recommend choosing them overall. Personally I'm sticking with my Klipsch T5 IIs for regular use, but if you are a diehard Apple user, I would have recommend the Airpods Pro over these LinkBuds S at the current prices. If these drop in price in the future and are competitively priced with some of the other options, then they might be a good choice; especially if switching back and forth between ecosystems is important to you and you don't mind the lack of wireless charging.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2022",AGJNDB3P4G3BWHS23YMSCRBRFIFA,True,356,Color: Black
R12X9VLBJKRPJP,B0BB5VBFRF,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressed,P.A.,5,"I had the WF-1000XM4 and they sounded great, had superb ANC, transparency, and features But what got me was the size. They are big, stick out from the ears, and impossible to lay in bed and listen to tunes or podcasts, because on the pillow side, it would push into the ear. And, due to the size, they would have the tendency to come loose and I would have to always readjust them. I've tried aftermarket ear tips, but generally the same result. Now homes the LinkBuds S. In many ways, they are like the mini XM4. They have none of the negatives that I had with the XM4's, although, you are missing a little bit. The ANC is better on the XM4's, as is the battery life. But like the big brother, they have superb sound. The ANC is really good (just not XM4 level) and the transparency is right up there, almost on par with them too. Being that it has a 6hr battery life (With the AAC codec - I use an iPhone, so no LDAC for me) and with ANC and transparency off, I can still get through a session of listening with no issues, as I never keep them in for more than a few hours at a time. They are by far more comfortable than the XM4's due to their size, which is considerably smaller. They almost sit flush in my ears. And they are lighter too. Performed many head shake tests, and these do not fail. Of course, your mileage may vary since not all ears are shaped the same. The photo shows them in the Spigen Rugged Armor case. Which I also recommend. I'm very impressed by these and I'm glad I bought them.","Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2023",AFX6CY6EGKPY5FKE37C2LLXTGAZA,True,12,Color: Black
RINCOH95UGPPV,B0BB5VBFRF,1.0 out of 5 stars Not for me,Javier Ruiz,1,"Starting with the good: these are good looking Ear buds, feel well built. The sound quality is also good, as is the ANC, which works very well. I also really like the touch controls. They work very well, and they can be modified from the Sony Headphones app.Now for the bad:They do not fit my ears very well. I recognize that this is very subjective, but for me, even with the largest tips in place, it feels like the buds are not very secure in my ears, meaning any strong movement of my head would be enough to dislodge them. This feeling is amplified by the fact that depending on how I put them in my ears, they feel more Or less secure. Most earbuds I have owned are designed to be secure when inserted. These.. not so much.The other big thing I don’t like is the app. It does work, for setting the modes (normal, transparency and ANC), as well as EQ settings and you can also set it up to work with Alexa (but not Siri for some reason). But what bothers me is that in order to use it, you have an agree to a lot of tracking and data collection. This is ostensibly to make some features work (like the ability to set profiles for different locations, like work; home, etc.) however, it make me think of his is a thinly veiled way to collect data of your movements. That is not something I care to do, so I declined it. But it is a shame that to unlock all the features of a device, you must consent to be tracked.UPDATE JULY 2023:I have downgraded my review from 3 to 1 stars, because in the short (and I mean really short) time that I have owned them, I find that they keep disconnecting from my phone at oddtimes. Today, for example, I was on a FaceTime call and my buds decided to disconnect halfway through it. Mind you, they were fully charged. This is unacceptable. The earbuds I had before stayed connected the entire time I was using them, not to mention their ANC and battery life was about on par with the Sony’s, but they were half the price of these!Another reason to dislike these: you will NOT get any notifications from Siri on these . The only assistant that will work with them is Alexa. At first it did not seem like such an issue because I usually activate Siri from my phone. But not being able to get actual, verbal notifications from Siri through these earbuds is amazing, considering the price. Again, my old buds did this too. I only replaced them because I lost them And stupidly, I thought these would be an upgrade. Goes to show that price is not always an indicator of quality. It used to be that when you bought something from Sony you knew you were getting a quality . But more and more these days, what you are paying for is the brand name recognition. That’s it.As for me, I think I will keep these for limited uses for the next year or two, and then I will dispose of them like the e-waste that they are. Seriously. Over $150 with taxes for a device to have such glaring omissions and poor quality, when other companies produce much better devices for a lot less? That’s unconscionable.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2023",AHIJXOAYGDXQN7RW2VM7CGWNBIIA,True,30,Color: White

I believe way better than the sony xm4 which I have. These will be my main. I really like the small form factor. They are more snugged in my ears and less obvious so I can wear them while I'm at work. The only downside is the battery doesn't last as long as the xm4. Xm4s I get about 7-8 hours playing medium loud bass music but with these, I get about 5-6. Seems to take longer to charge as well. Thankfully, I can use the xm4 and the s link interchangeably so the battery is not a problem at all. 10/10.Another helpful thing I want to mention, I believe ""S"" stands for silent since a lot of people were complaining about the voice commands in the Sony Xm4. These ones, do not have any voice command when you switch from ambient to ANC. It's completely silent.","Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2023",AHHMMFP22NU35JFB6FALOBEEAKXQ,True,18,Color: Black
R32Q1G43LPWAC5,B0BB5VBFRF,3.0 out of 5 stars Uninpressive...even on sale,Ian,3,"Let me start this by remarking that while I’ve been using Bluetooth earbuds since they came out, I only really have one set that is comparable to the linkbuds S, which is the Sennheiser CX plus buds I got a year ago. It’s a pretty even comparison from price and features (I got them both on sale).If you just care about good sound for music, call clarity, and comfort, then you might just love the Linkbuds S. If you care about features like transparent hearing mode, battery life, noise canceling, or app usability…I’d recommend that you keep looking.Sound: Even after taking pictures of my ears (awkward), testing tips for optimal ear pressure, and all the other things Sony wanted me to do, my CX plus buds out of the box sound better. 360 sound and app optimization was snake oil if you ask me. It is not a huge difference with most music, but I can really tell when listening to podcasts or audiobooks. The CX plus sound like the person is reading to you in a silent room, while the linkbuds sound no different than my 4 year old $30 generic buds. I even tried changing to the comply foam tips I use in all my buds, and while it usually improves things, I couldn’t tell the difference when using the linkbuds.Call Clarity/Singal: A tie here. Both have very clear call clarity on both ends. I had no problems with singals dropping in Bluetooth heavy areas, both had similar range, and I carry my phone in my front pocket and never had drops with either.Comfort/size: The Linkbuds S win this category by a massive margin. They are comfortable and conforming. So much so that this is the only aspect that gave me pause when returning them. This is where the foam tips usually come into play, but the linkbuds were just always comfortable regardless of the tips. MY CX plus buds get very uncomfortable after a couple hours which made me really appreciate the linkbuds in this regard.ANC/Transparency mode: A big nope on both. For Transparency mode, my CX plus buds might have me spoiled, but I love that mode because it sounds natural, but boosted. The linkbuds makes everything sound tinny, like I’m walking around with a really cheap mic in my hands. I don’t really use ANC, but using foam tips seemed to do more than the ANC on the linkbuds, and even with them I could still hear everything around me. In comparison, I don’t use the CX plus ANC because it works so well that I get paranoid about something possibly sneaking up on me.Battery life: Linkbuds S have a laughable battery life. With all the bells and whistles on I got about 2.25 hours, or 4 hours with everything off; both with the volume halfway. CX plus usually give me 6 with ANC on and 8 without at the same volume.APP/Features: Both the Linkbuds S and CX plus have wonky apps. Some stuff with both are a little fiddly. I am sure that’s probably true with most apps the way software is rushed out anymore. Both have things I don’t like. Linkbuds S I can have Transparency/ANC or one feature and off, but not all 3 even through there are open commands (maybe I’m doing something wrong here). The CX plus allows me to do all three. Multipoint is done the same way, but credit goes to the linkbuds here because I can change to different devices without having to have both buds out. The Linkbuds have a feature that, if activated, can pause audio and turn transparency on when you speak…nice, but it also activates when you cough, hum, or clear your throat which I apparently do constantly, so I ended up not liking this feature at all and kept it off.CXplus claim IPX7 to Linkbuds S’s IPX4. I’m not keen on testing either as I like my electronics dry.Linkbuds S have a smaller, more pocket friendly case, CX Plus has a case with more battery. Linkbuds have a slightly rough matte texture, CX Plus is shiny smooth plastic. Both are subjective and will come down to personal preference.I wish I had more buds to compare them to, but I’m cheap, so I don’t. Depending on what you’re after, these might be great for you (when on sale…a total rip at MSRP), but I returned them. Maybe the next generation will be better and I will be watching because they were pretty darn comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2022",AGWNPY4BDD4VATB6NV7W2BXOITHQ,True,34,Color: Black
R2RVAS25KM959D,B0BB5VBFRF,2.0 out of 5 stars They were the best of buds. They were the worst of buds.,doublePlusConsume,2,"In a word, these are inconsistent. Okay-ish on android. Intolerable on Windows 11. Bad for calls. Save money and buy more basic buds or another brand.Pros:- When they work, they sound quite good.- Very light weight- Pretty good fit for my small and assymetric ears. Have had one fall out when washing my face, but have stayed in otherwise, though I haven't tried running with them.- Decent for biking when I have a stocking cap over them (not too much wind noise).- Good customer support. I used the chat feature on the sony site. They stepped me through a reset (classic, I know), and it fixed a 'tinny' sound issue I was having on windows.- Ambient noise feature is sorta cool. It's sorta the opposite of noise cancelling and passes sound from the environment through. This is nice on a bike or when you're around people you might want to hear. Terrible for calls though.Cons:- Regardless of NC/AN settings in app, these pipe through ambient noise during calls. I talked to customer service and this is by design. (face palm). The result is any noise in the environment is on only piped through to your ears, but actually amplified, making calls very hard if there are medium or high level noises around. Also, those you are talking to hear it all as well. I pretty much always have to mute myself when I'm not talking during calls, which is obnoxious for one on one calls.- inconsistency #1: windows 11 sound quality ranges from normal to extra tinny. Anecdote. Was watching youtube with them on my laptop. Sound quality was good for 30 mins, then there was a blip, and they sounded extra tinny. I put them back in the case, took them back out. Still tinny. I re-installed the app on my phone to see if I could change a setting that would fix it. Factory Reset. No dice.- Noise cancelling doesn't really work for dynamic sound or loud environments. Tried using it in a cafe where they were using a mixer. Made my head want to explode. The app also doesn't tell you what mode you're in, so I actually just feel like I'm guess if I'm in ANC mode or ambient mode or normal mode. I've never owned anc headphones, so not sure if this is normal, but in anc mode, it feels like my ears are pressurized. Which, hell, they might be?! Using sound to fight sound (destructive interference), as ANC does, it plausibly increases the pressure between the buds and your ear drum. Not sure.- Also, ANC on windows 11 seems to be constantly toggling on/off every 10 - 40 seconds. Really, really obnoxious.- The app for android is quite complicated as it has to allow the management of many, many features. Sony might be biting off more than they can chew here... I would find it a challenge to enumerate the number of features they attempted to implement with these... I think it might introduce more issues than it solves. Sorta wish I'd bought a simpler pair of buds.- inconsistency #2: android app may cause inconsistent call experience. I use these for work calls I have each morning. The connection was really intermittent. Over my first 2 hours of using for calls, I'd say they disconnected on their own about 7 times... Sometimes briefly. Other times I had to go back into BT settings on my phone and reconnect... Ufta. I haven't had this problem since I uninstalled the app. (I reinstalled the app and may add a follow up to the review).TLDR.Good earbuds ruined by bad software.Super inconsistent and sound terrible (tinny) when connected to windows 11.On android, disconnects frequently during calls.If they are acting funny reset them by putting one bud in the case.

R2VW718GF8F6PX,B0BB5VBFRF,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great in theory, but doesn’t hold up",Hayden,2,"Edit to fix my grammarLong review. TLDR: ANC doesn’t work efficiently with constant wind noises blowing in left ear. Transparency sounds whiny, tinny, and almost unuseable. Shotty BT connection. Lack luster app. Sound is good, but only after tweaking the EQ. Switched back to my AirPod gen 1s. Pretty disappointed.So I’ve been using the AirPods 1st gen for about 5 years now. They have always been good, done me right, but they have been crapping out so I decided to look around for new ear buds.I did plenty research and everything came back to these. The price seemed right for what was being advertised. I got them, out of the box was cool, I knew it needed some tweaking, but not too bad. The Transparency was a bit whiny and tinny, but not unbearable. The sound was great, nice bass and what not but I did mess with the EQ a bit then got a nice sound. Audio enhancing, the ear forming schtick, all that fun stuff. This was the first day.The second day was when they were gonna be fully used, as I have my earbuds in almost all day at work, switching between listening to music/podcast, to just pausing the sound and forgetting they are there.Everything was cool, I was digging the transparency and having the podcast on at the same time, the ANC was satisfying. I was able to have a backpack leaf blower on and barely hear it. Of course, ANC was on, and I had my music near full blast. I didn’t do much physical activity that day, so they stayed in my ears well. After a while, I didnt notice them.But then comes the 2nd day. I’m getting ready for work, getting them on, and I notice the left ears transparency was far more intense than the right. The right felt normal, but the left felt like there was someone constantly blowing air into the mic. It was pretty jarring, but it was easily able to drown out in the music/podcast- with transparency on. But with the ANC setting on, it was near mind rattling.The ANC seemed like it didn’t do what it’s suppose to, like the Transparency mode was still active, but only in the left ear. The right felt as it was suppose to, but the left seemed to have no difference between ANC and Transparency.Only when I turned the ANC setting off, and just relied on the seal from the buds themself for the noise cancelling, that wind sound went away. This was the trouble shoot solution that SONY THEMSELVES recommended. Basically saying “just don’t use the ANC feature that you paid to get”Sure, easy fix, but the transparency still started to go, on top of the whiny and tinny sound. Which, the 2nd day, it was almost unusable as the voices came through way too intense and loud, with too much white noise being picked up.This day as well, I was doing some landscaping and was a bit more labor intensive but nothing crazy. These things would not stay in. I’d shove them in, get a solid seal, and then gradually they would fall out. I’ll give it the fact that I was making some hard movments as I was digging in dirt, but even later in the day, simple walking was making them want to fall out. I kept it going, giving them the benefit of the doubt maybe I need to change sizes, all that.I’m driving home, and decide to keep them both in so I can really break in the sound. But as I was driving, I kept having stuttering and quick disconnects. With my phone on my lap, the case in my pocket, I was getting real bad BT connection. Maybe it was the change of internet signals or whatever, if that’s even a factor. I ended up taking them out and using my car stereo because of how bad it got bad.Day 3 rolls around, and all the same issues. Constant heavy wind sound blowing through my left ear, which then eventually switched to the right. Same issues not staying in my ear, I changed buds and smalls were too small, and the large were too large. I suck it up, and keep using them for the day. Trying to mess with the settings and see what I can do. Nothing much able to change.Then My phone starts dying so I decide to plug it in, and keep it off my person, only about 20ft at most away from me at any time, and these things were stuttering and losing connection so bad. I was still within such close proximity to my phone and the case, outside of a building, no walls or anything to impede the connection, and I couldn’t get more then 10-15ft without connection problems. That was very frustrating. I should be able to have my phone within a more reasonable distance to keep a solid connection.I did go into the settings and re-prioritized the Connection Quality over Sound Quality, and that seemed to have made it even worst. This was after a full day of being generally uncomfortable wearing these.The app for these seemed really dated. I understand a BT headphone app not being super crazy innovative, but this one seemed hyped up with unnoticeable change. The added features such as the spatial audio, ear forming, auto voice detection, we’re all very lack luster.I was very excited to try these out and get something other than AirPods, but even after doing extensive research on Wireless Earbuds and came to these conclusions, I am very disappointed. If I’m paying a decent amount on ear buds that have all the bells and whistles, i want the bells and whistles. I didn’t buy ANC, Transparency, in-depth ear buds, to not even be able to use those features because they are just overall uncomfortable to use.I already issued a return, and went back to my old gen 1 AirPods. I am more than likely go for the AirPod Pro 2.This could all be subjective and personal issues with my specific device, but even with that, that calls for mad inconsistency and I’m over all very disappointed that after all my research, it came down to this.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2023",AEJFITBSWYHUHUFJ6X25V6YKJQKA,True,31,Color: Black

R2K7G07EYZWATC,B0BB5VBFRF,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall an excellent choice,M. Fischer,4,"I'm an Android user so while many glom towards their Apple AirPods, it's simply a non starter for me. Prior to getting these Sony LinkBuds S, I was using a wired Bose ear pod which worked quite well but the cable was getting in the way and the wired connection to my phone was getting a bit wonky.These Sony LinkBuds S models are very comfortable and paired instantly with my Pixel 6 Pro. As with most products, you need to download a vendor specific app to update the software and complete the setup. Once all this was done, these ear buds are simply a matter of placing them in your ear and they ""just work"" as expected.The sound is pleasant though I see how this is a personal taste. Music plays fine and there have not been any complaints about sound quality or clarity on phone calls.The only complaint I have is around the various gestures required on each bud for different functions. One tap for this, two taps for that, etc. The most useful function to me was tapping on one ear bud for volume up and the other for volume down. I still have coordination issues of tapping the right spot on the ear bud.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. They were a reasonable price and work well. The battery life is acceptable getting 5+ hours of continuous use. The charge can be topped off in a few minutes to get you another hour or more relatively quickly. But earbuds are a personal choice and for me, this was a good choice.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AESH5RGFZ2WX2DNW5RTDYTKFG7DA,True,1,Color: White
R1XJA49T6LJUU,B0BB5VBFRF,4.0 out of 5 stars Quite a Nice Pair of Noise-cancelling Earbuds,Amy,4,"These replaced my AirPods, which are a great product; their battery life was lessening, and there were some bluetooth problems with them, so I needed another pair. At the suggestion of a tech friend, I bought these.For the most part, I am very satisfied with their performance. They are comfortable, which wasn't what I expected when my friend told me that they're more intrusive in terms of how far they go into your ears. The sets of tips that accompany them are useful so that you can adjust their sizing.Using them is a breeze. It's obvious what the buttons and gestures do. Pairing them up to my devices was also a simple matter.I'm happy with the sound quality. I listen to both music and audio books, and these offer more than I expected.The noise cancelling is also quite good. This comes in handy because we have very loud neighbors, and I also use it on the bus when other passengers are yammering too much on their phones or blaring music through tinny phone speakers. Having three settings is nice; I used to have a headset that allowed you to turn noise canceeling either off or on.You'll probably be impressed with the battery life and how quickly they charge back up. I often have something playing for hours without an issue.These are not prone to slipping out, either of your ears or their case. I've dropped them a few times or knocked them off a table, and they stayed put, and I've never lost one while bending over or moving around.One major complaint: They do not provide any sort of Find My ability. The Apple AirPods do. If you drop one or both earbuds, assuming you've thought ahead and enabled Find My on an Apple device, they'll play a sound so you can locate what you've lost. These do not have this at all. I wish they'd add that feature. Fortunately, as I said before, they aren't prone to fall out very often, and if you do drop them, their shape makes them a bit less likely to bounce.There are a number of very good earbuds on the market. These are certainly well worth considering.","Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2023",AGWBTSZRFVPDWVAULXWNJO5H4KWA,True,2,Color: Black

Not being able to turn off noise cancellation or ambient mode is a bit annoying, and kind of ruins the experience for me.Another issue I was having is that it doesn't seem the case is charging my earbuds very well. I only use them when I am home from work, and even leaving them in the case the entire time, I get maybe 2 hours at most of use out of the right earbud before it dies.

R1LRNYGVPC12O8,B0BB5VBFRF,4.0 out of 5 stars Small eared humans- rejoice!,Katie Rausch,4,"I have been using my Skullcandy wired earbuds for as long as possible but it came time for me to find a true wireless earbud to wear to the gym/on the Peloton. I tried my husband’s AirPods and 1. They felt like they were going to fall right out of my head and 2. They hurt that little cartilage spot right before the ear canal entrance. Ppl with small ears… you know the spot I’m talking about! Instant pain and pressure spot. So we tried the other brand owned by Apple started by one Dr. Dre. Cool colors, but still hurt my sad little ears. The search continued…So I turned to Amazon, Reddit, Target, Best Buy, pouring over each review section in search of some clues for a review about each bud and their compatibility with small ears. Knowing that Sony is an old standby for most, I just went ahead and added them to the cart along with a Soundcore pair. The package arrived, the Souncore buds with stems hurt even more than the AirPods did. NEXT! The Sony packaging was fairly nice, recycled materials which I appreciated. Once I slipped them in **cue a chorus of Heavenly Host**. At last! A relatively secure earbud that didn’t hurt my ear cartilage! I downloaded the app and paired them to my phone and Peloton with just a tidbit of troubleshooting research. The sound coming through was almost as good as the Beats I tried. Certainly more than adequate bass for the size. The app has an equalizer option but right off the bat is was fairly well balanced for listening to Fred Again.. . Not too tinny at all. The touch commands are also intuitive! Touch the left bud and it changes from noise cancelling to ambient. Touch the right and it plays/pauses the music. I don’t have anything to say about talking on phone calls with them 🤷‍♀️ it’s just not what I need them for. I need them for exercise.Why I reduced a star: I really wish I could give it 4.5 stars honestly, and here’s why:1. The pairing wasn’t exactly intuitive. You have to have one bud in, have the other one in the case, have the case open and long press the case button to get it to pair to secondary devices (such as the Peloton).2. It makes a click when I’m running.3. The case just doesn’t have that satisfying heft that other bud cases have. And the plastic is rough feeling. Does that matter? Absolutely not. But if we’re rating overall experience it’s worth mentioning.So if you have small ears and have yet to find the right pair of true wireless earbuds, do yourself a favor and get these. Are they the best on the market? No. But they don’t hurt! And that’s the BEST selling point.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2023",AHXNVWCL76VTQPWCUPCBI74WVX7A,True,64,Color: Black

R28UN8C1AYN7QZ,B0BB5VBFRF,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall good set of earbuds,Ryan,4,"I have only ever used the original AirPods design since they came out. I enjoy how they can sit in my ears without causing them to hurt after prolonged listening. But they let in many sounds, and it's not worth using outdoors or in noisy conditions like a college dorm.So that is when I looked at Sony's LinkBuds S. They were on sale for around $148 at the time of purchase in August, and I sprung for the deal!The noise canceling is pretty decent; it's my first experience with ANC, but I was slightly underwhelmed. But I don't expect every sound to disappear at this price point.The Buds' sound is excellent and crisp. I personally noticed a little less bass when listening to music. Still, I downloaded the Sony app and tweaked the EQ settings to my style.When purchasing these, I was tempted to wait for AirPods Pro 2, but I needed something relatively new for college.The right side Bud does hurt my ear; I think it is because my right ear may be shaped differently. Not sure. I kind of ignore the uncomfortable feeling. I had another set of cheap silicone-tipped earbuds, and they did the same thing in my right ear, so I think this discomfort is just for me or other people with different shaped ears. And yes, I did try different silicone ear tips, but it didn't work. I might have to experiment with that a little more.The case and buds look very cool, especially with the mate feeling, unlike the AirPods case, which is slippery and scratches easily. I think you do not need an exterior case for the case, as it will barely show wear and tear.I'm very surprised by Sony's packaging. They created a box to use the space as much as possible. Very little to no plastic use, very cool, in my opinion. They are doing more than Apple or Samsung in the "" Eco-Friendly "" department in this technology era.Battery life is excellent, although I don't use them for that long anyways at a time. I don't walk everywhere with earbuds in my ears.Overall, I recommend these buds for people who may go between ""ecosystems"" like windows, iOS, etc. These buds can be paired to (but not connected to at the same time) up to 8 devices. Unfortunately, they do not offer multiple device support (connected to 2 or more devices simultaneously). This may be inconvenient, but switching between devices takes less than a second, but you have to do it manually.However, seeing the price back up near $200, my recommendation lessens. I would say go for it if they stayed at $140-$150. Not sure If I can recommend them when they are so close to AirPods Pro Gen 2 earbuds.But despite the price, good overall experience with my first Sony product. They will probably go down in price this year, hopefully.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2022",AGS6Z3I2JERIAJQXX3JDGXEUBL4Q,True,19,Color: Black

Tried the Anker Space A40 (made a hair dryer sound like a banshee ) and they have rad battery life, lightweight kind of awkward fit for me. Anker Space Q45—yes the over ear. The ANC is practically the same between these and the linkbuds s. So you decide on the 50H battery or the lightweight reduced sweat linkbuds. Anker Liberty 4, better ANC than space 40, but still had a weird pickup and extra background. Linkbuds S was better and similar price ($150 new) Plus the right side touch didn’t work so… Beats fit pro… this was closeeee. The ANC was just a smidge better. If I remember right it was the lower tones was a smidge better. The transparency was more natural on the beats, but boy did I like the light fit of the Sony. You could def get used to the fit of the wing of the beats. It was a more secure fit than the linkbuds s. But it just didn’t perform that much better to justify. Price was same at the time $150. I just liked the ANC on the Sonys a smidge more. This was a tough call and I wouldn’t fault you for going against me. Linkbuds s vs WF 1000MX4. I loved my MX4s. The ANC was the best and great audio. The fit and lightweight of the linkbuds s is superior. To the point where I will sacrifice the ANC difference. I can fall asleep on my side with them on (not desirable but much easier to do). The linkbuds s are just comfy!!! Light, smaller profile. Audio is good. ANC is just all most there. I do like the wireless charging of the wf100000mxxx4 case, but I didn’t realize it had until 3/4 of the way through ownership… The smaller case of the linkbuds is cooler too. I tend to wear and walk around town. So the case stays in my pocket, I drop in a store or bar, they charge and then I keep going. I did the same with the wf100xm45 but the linkbuds are more comfy in the pockets of my booty shorts. My only gripe is I need to find a/m tips to make the linkbuds 100.

I can hear an improvement over my old ones. The problem is that the sound cuts out randomly. They are paired with a Pixel phone. I have had no problem in the past with Sony earbuds paired with a Pixel. I tried changing a few settings. Turned noise cancellation on and off. They still cut out periodically. They are also very sensitive when touching them for volume or to pause your music. At times they don't respond immediately when pausing and restarting music and I end up tapping them a few times and they stop and start back up. But the features do work.Battery life is ok but they and the charger don't seem to last as long as my WF-C500's. (Could be me. I have also left the buds out of the case a few times) I do like the size and shape of the charger though. It fits in my pocket more comfortably. The buds fit my ears fine but, of course, I can't speak as to how they will fit for others.Since I don't use them for long periods of time they are ok. I will deal with the cutting out.

Luckily it changes fast in the case, but still wish it was better. Can me improved by changing codec or disabling noise cancellation.* Only supports LDAC for high bitrate. AptX Adaptive is less prone to dropouts and consumes less power to process, and aptX HD, which more of a lateral move, would be good to see too for wider overall support.Other notes:Using a low bitrate codec like AAC really does improve battery life and connection stability over LDAC - I tend to select it in noisy environments when I might not be able to appreciate the subtle improvement anyways.Case is slim, light, and slightly textured, but still a bit slippery. Comfortable to carry in a side pocket, but the door feels a little flimsy and I don't know if it would survive being sat on in a back pocket (also a little too large to be comfortable to sit on for that matter) so I would avoid back pocket storage.","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2023",AFUYU4NDZUGXCQ47362W7F3DLC3A,True,2,Color: Earth Blue
R2OGZA9EQA78TK,B0BB5VBFRF,"3.0 out of 5 stars Fine, I guess. Fine.",ihsan,3,"These new mid-grade earbuds from Sony get fantastic pro reviews. Source after source states that they compete favorably with the WF-1000XM4 / 5, but at half the price or less. And so, I tried them out to replace my 1000XM4s.I tried them for one day.Positive thoughts:They are light -- very light! As a result, they were comfortable to wear, which I can't say about the bigger 1000-series line (even the new XM5s). The battery life seemed to be amazing. I wore them for many hours, and was still around 90% when I was finished.Negative thoughts:The sound quality and ANC is a definite step below the 1000-series. They did an amazing job inside my living room -- the music sounded rich, and the world was dead calm. But once I got them out on my nighttime walk, I found the ANC very weak in the mid-range -- passing cars were barely muted. Higher frequency ambient noise (a sound-walled freeway I come within 1/8 mile of) was almost negligibly different on ""Noise Cancelling"" mode versus ""Ambient Sound 20"". That's ... clearly not working right.I kept hearing this buzz that accompanied voices in my audio lesson, coming from my left earpiece. It was distracting, so I switched to music. Then the buds starting skipping, cutting out, and producing scratchy interference. It got worse and worse for 10 minutes before I just turned them off, and walked home in silence. This was on the latest firmware and software.Verdict:I probably got a malfunctioning unit. But while these aren't as expensive as the 1000-series, they aren't really a ""budget"" offering in the sector -- quality control is still important. I was soured, and Amazon's generous return policy allowed me to try other offerings while the holiday sales were still in full swing.Take a chance if you wish. Maybe they're really good, and all my troubles were rooted in poor luck. I have high standards from Sony, and my expectations weren't really met here.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2023",AFEWD5OIVTCGOQ44PWNT2JAFZIUQ,True,2,Color: White

I bought these specifically for the fact that they're supposed to be good for small ears and they don't disappoint. The sound quality is decent but I'd expect a little better for $200.The case feels cheap and plastic-y but I put a case on it so it's fine. Pretty good noise cancellation, though I'm not an audio expert. I have noticed the Bluetooth randomly cutting out and disconnecting sometimes. Charges very fast. Overall a solid pair of earbuds I'd say, but wait for a sale and don't spend $200 like I did. There are probably better-sounding earbuds in that price range.

R231GTT5IER8ER,B0BB5VBFRF,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds Great for $158,RyceBall,4,"I've been eyeing these buds since they were released but was hesitant to purchase them due to the mixed reviews for the ANC, even with the initial launch discount. That said, my new neighbors are frat boys who party at any hour and are destroying my night-shift body's minimal sleep schedule. And, while I do have noise canceling technology (Bose Headphones), they aren't devices that one can wear comfortably in bed. As such, I decided to bite the bullet when these buds went on sale on Prime Day for $158.Having worn these now for a few hours, I'll share my current thoughts: - ANC is far from sub-par. You might notice a decrease in quality if you're used to the high-end stuff, but if you're like me and your only experience with NC are headphones that create pressure on your ears, this is certainly a worthy purchase. The Sony app is still learning to adjust (it has only been a few hours after all) so I'll sometimes hear my fan on full blast if I move locations, but the earbuds adjust and make the fan noise completely vanish within about 15 seconds. - I consider myself to have ears on the smaller scale (I'm 5'1"") and am usually skeptical of earbuds that have a round body. That said, these have not yet caused any ear pain and the Medium ear tips (these are the tips that are on the earbuds when you open the box) had a fairly comfortable fit. After a few hours, I decided to try the Small ear tips and realized that they were the better fit for the fact that the earbud bodies sat more snugly in my ears and didn't protrude as much. Unfortunately, I found that the Small tips were a tad too small for my ears as the NC could no longer completely block out the sound of my fan. After about 5-10 minutes of bouncing between the Medium and Small tips, I decided to stick with the Medium tips since NC was of better quality. And it's not like I'm worried about the buds falling out of my ears. - Charging is fairly simple, both for the buds and the case. I did notice that some folks here were upset about the lack of wireless charging but, as a cat parent, I find the ability to charge my case via a secure cable extremely reassuring.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2022",AHOITHGYFO27PCLD3BHGJ6HJDYNQ,True,11,Color: Black
R3IR36RC9XGR1M,B0BB5VBFRF,2.0 out of 5 stars Review after 16 months,Patrick Frembs,2,"Overall, I liked the sounds quality and the ANC.Being able to only use the right ear bud when I want to use only one is rather annoying (I can't just switch to the right one when the battery dies but rather have to put the left one back in the case and wait for it to be charged again). That also resulted in the right ear bud battery overall becoming weaker than the left ear bud. Too many ear buds out there let you use the left and right one individually.Why I would not recommend these ear buds to anyone is the clicking/popping sounds in my right ear bud.First I thought it was moisture (while working out) but I have been having this popping for weeks now and after doing some research, this seems to be more common than I would like for these Sony ear buds.It seems to be an issue with the seal rings and pressure that it just keeps releasing pressure and make this popping sound (regardless of whether the buds are on or off - always the same popping sounds).I reached out to Sony and in polite words, they basically said ""you're on your own with this issue"".When I asked if I can send them to them to fix them, they only sent me a link to a 3rd party (none Sony) company that I can send my earbuds to and they can maybe look at it and fix it - or not.....After researching, this popping sounds seems to be quite an issue (just google ""Sony Linkbud S clicking sound"" and do your own research before you spend a fair amount of money on buds that seem to have a design issue that can't be solved.It's unfortunate that I had to trash these after 16 months.I just bought the Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds II (bought from Bose directly as Amazon customer service these days is about as helpful as Sony) and I couldn't be happier.If you end up buying the Sony, I hope they work for you and don't end up causing issues down the road!I used to like Sony but especially after the customer service acknowledge the issue and was very quick to understand the issue and yet not helping me in any way (and I don't mean helping as in paying to fix it or sending me new ones) but rather pushing me towards some 3rd party company to deal with them - no thank you Sony.There are way better ear buds and customer service out there for this amount of money.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2024",AFDWO5BGZ4B3TZWQUUAEEZ2MNM2Q,True,1,Color: White

RUHC3GGD8FXOO,B0BB5VBFRF,2.0 out of 5 stars Intentionally Missing Featured for Being a Cheaper Model,Kindle Customer,2,"I originally bought Sony's WF-1000XM5 Earbuds at retail price. They sounded amazing and the noise cancelling was superb -- Only issue was, no matter the tips, it simply would not fit in my head.I read some Reddit accounts of different earbuds and found that people said the Linkbuds S have a far better fit, so I bought them on sale and returned the XM5's. They were absolutely correct, and they fit perfectly. But now, since it's a cheaper model, it has arbitrary restrictions such as the controls not being combined into one setting [ Can't adjust volume + music and ambient noise like you can with the XM5's ], or not having spotify / music service buttons despite having a CPU powerful enough to run real-time DSEE [ Compression reversal ] whilst cancelling noise.I don't get it. there is nothing stopping them from being as usable as the XM5's, yet they choose to screw over the consumer anyways. As for sound quality, it's way too bassy and cancels the mids to an uncomfortable level. If you want to make it better with software, don't use the built-in EQ -- The autoEQ on wavelet runs circles around Sony's software for any type of music.Bottom line, they're worth it if they're on sale, but I wouldn't get these at retail price. They have sales fairly often, though, and I ended up getting my pair for about $120.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AFV264U2LEMTWYQBF4DGJEWUA7YA,True,0,Color: Black
R3664USQ1A8NAM,B0BB5VBFRF,4.0 out of 5 stars Not for cyclists or bikers,Alex R.,4,"This review is for cyclists and bikers wondering if it cancels the wind noise. No, it doesn't. No current ANC technology does. I tried it both on my bicycle and motorcycle. I tries to combat the outside noise - way better than anything else on the market - other than the over the ear headphones like Sony's top of the line XM4 I have, which obviously wouldn't fit under either (cycling or motorcycle) helmet. Yes, you can crank up the volume, but what the point? They will cancel noise if you ride below 75mph. Let's skip the legalities, because driving or even riding a bicycle with earphones is as illegal, as speeding, though you really need to piss off the cop (with something else) to get a ticket for that. Safety-wise I rely on my eyes and mirrors - another reason why you won't find any cycling or helmet headset or earphones that cancels all the outside noise. No corporation would want that liability.Other than the two specific applications above I bought the earphones for, it excels in the sound quality, comfort, and the ANC department. One thing that truly stands out is the transparence mode. It beats Earpods Pro and the likes by a large margin. So if noisy city apartment or annoying coworkers is your kind of issues, go for it.As far as the battery life everyone complains about, it's no better or worse than other LDAC-capable earphones like my Soundcores - which offer an even better sound quality w/o the ANC.","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2023",AGFH3NZDGE7MTETNXE5XVULZLJIQ,True,8,Color: Black
R8761LOCNG8AT,B0BB5VBFRF,4.0 out of 5 stars Good At Almost Everything,Wesley M.,4,"The design on these is excellent in my opinion. Their not so big and therefore not too heavy which makes wearing them for long periods of time no problem at all. The fit will of course be different for everyone, but in my case these don't slip off my ears what so ever. The case and earbuds themselves have a matt grippy texture on them, which definitely help prevent drops when taking them in or out of pockets and placing them in or out of ears.The default sound on these will please those that are into bass dominant music, and while vocals aren't excellent, they are still exceptional. There is also a companion app by Sony on the App Store and Play Store to configure the sound more to one's preference.My ears do find that these can get loud if needed. For times like these, it might be a good idea trying out the noise cancelling feature before blowing your ears out. I'm surprised how effective noise cancelling can be when in crowded events like wedding parties. Transperency mode makes it possible to hear someone without taking off the earbuds by doing one simple tap. This works just fine when indoors, but in windy environments it is better just taking off the earbuds completely because wind noise gets amplified when in transperency mode.Overall these Sony earbuds are great. Just wish the microphones were slightly better, and for voices to sound more natural during transperency mode.The option for other colors like silver or burgundy would have been cool too.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2023",AEG4OWU6OOPLR7G7YRN6ZKWECC6A,True,4,Color: Black

I have an iPhone but wanted to move away from Apples ecosystem and have always had an appreciation for Sony products. The Beats solo's that I have are okay on sound quality but wanted something better. Sony headphones have the reputation of have the best acoustics of all the mainstream headphone makers.The fit of the earphones are good, occasionally will have to twist the earbuds to get a good seal but, they stay inside the ear and having had them fall out yet. Unlike Apple headphones, Sony comes with a app with an equalizer that allows you to further custom the sound quality. And the sound quality was everything that was said about these earbuds. For the size and price of what they are you can really hear things that my Beats leaves mumbled.The case is light with a very textile feel to it and the battery life is very good when paired with the earphones and quickly charges.One of the negative points is that when played on the iPhone the Bluetooth is a bit weak and will cut of one or both channels.

R37F6TWDEWSOA4,B0BB5VBFRF,"3.0 out of 5 stars Feels good, but only for a moment.",Rudy,3,"So, a few key things to say about this product, and how I use it. This rating is purely based on my experience with it.On my end, first, I went with a refurbished version. Second, I'll easily use them 8-12 hours a day, definitely more than some people. 3rd, I'm often in somewhat louder environments.How have these Sony earbuds held up? A few weeks in, I have had some serious issues with the noise cancelling aspect. Sometimes, one or both earbuds will give loud, high pitched, static or feedback. The only thing that seemed to 'fix' that issue is by putting both bids back into the case to reset them. The other option is actually to turn the noise cancelling off in the app. I'd say that's the biggest issue.A somewhat minor problem is, the app almost gets in the way more than it helps. I cannot leave the Adaptive Sound Control on, as it changes my settings too often. I prefer to use the Ambient Sound Control (single tap) option, but then you cannot turn off noise cancelling altogether to fix the giant feedback issue. Not really as important is the battery life. Often, I will only get 5 hours in before having to charge them. If I could run noise cancelling on, it actually extends battery life by being able to turn the volume down. Issues have arisen there, however.I actually Really like how quickly they charge, though. Really did great there. The equalizer included within the app feels decent enough, and the sound is about as good as I've heard.In all, I do not know if I would say these were worth the money I spent on them. Some issues may have been the fact I went with refurbished, but if it is certified refurbished, then that's Sony endorsed. If they don't want me complaining about issues on a refurbished product, tighten those reins. If they chopped the full price for new ones in half (closer to $100-$110), I'd definitely go for them.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2022",AEXCSIBUIRP3RCKPCY5H3HOG2EQQ,True,1,Color: White

R17XALWPHBOVSZ,B0BB5VBFRF,5.0 out of 5 stars Multipoint connections make these the best earbuds I've ever used,pcaugh,5,"Love these buds and Sony has really come through with the latest firmware. The earbuds are so comfortable, and the new multipoint connection feature makes them so much better. Switching audio between devices is just brilliant and on demand. You don't have to have the same manufacturer's equipment for it to work like Samsung or Apple multipoint solutions. You can connect any manufacturer's device. There appears to be more tweaks to this update than just multipoint. The mids and bass seem a bit improved using existing EQ settings. I am not seeing any difference in battery usage connecting one vs two multipoint devices.The range of my bluetooth seems improved and I'm keeping connections further away than before the update. LDAC seems to be the biggest drain on battery as before. LDAC does work with multipoint if the source you are currently listening to supports LDAC. I tend to switch to LDAC when listening to music and AAC (big battery saver) for podcasts, videos. Using transparency or noise cancellation vs ANC off seem less battery intensive than before the update.My only beef is that I wish there was a smarter way to designate specific apps to use LDAC vs AAC or other codecs vs having to manually change it every time. I have two pair and have not seen any battery drain or uneven battery usage between the L or R as has been reported. Just one glitch I'm noticing is when I disconnect one pair and connect the other. Previously, it just happened. Now it is quicker when I go to the Headphones app and manually switch to the other set. After the switch, it reconnects just as easily as before and reconnects to multipoint connections quickly.Correction - I can be listening to LDAC on Tidal and pause it, play a video off my laptop and it switches automatically from LDAC to AAC and back to LDAC when I pause the laptop and go back to Tidal on my phone.

Specifically assigning functions only to one ear bud or the other, requiring both to be mostly functional. I end up using just the right ear most of the time as it is the “touch to respond” or “play/pause” functions, with the noise cancelling being assigned only to the right. With my premium pair of apple AirPods I can do both from both and alternate between each ear piece. Sony any apple could easily make these functions universal between both premium and budget pairs they just choose to make one influence the other.If I didn’t own a pair of the expensive earbuds I probably would be blissfully unaware of the intentional drawbacks of these.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2023",AFNAIPXQFB4IRL7G2ZQKKJAZ3G5Q,True,1,Color: Black

I can say definitively that the JBL Mini NC 2 I had were much better in sound quality, bass feel, staying put in my ears, and the noise canceling features. These Sonys fall short on just about every front except that the haptic buttons for controlling playback and hear-thru are better than my JBL ones that were so finicky that it felt like I was pushing my eardrums in every time I pressed a button. The Sony's sound is alright, its pretty good, but because the buds don't sit well in my ear, and don't stay seated as my jaw moves around, the sound and the ANC often fall short of what is promised. The bass isn't terribly powerful, and I found that coming off the daily use of my JBLs I had to mess with the Sony EQ to get comparable sound and bass out of them. I got a pair of refurbished ear buds for $87 and they feel like I got a good deal on a pair of solid $100 headphones... not a steal on $200 because these don't feel like $200 headphones.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",AFMNVB43FKDWT6OVRHWZCWJZMPYA,True,0,Color: Black

Unfortunately, for no readily obvious reason, the right earbud (I used this one the most by itself) suddenly held half the battery it used to, even after charging. They still sound good and the left bud battery is the same, but I'll consider them broken as they just do not function how they should anymore. For the price point, this is extremely disappointing. I cannot even return them at this point.

I leave the other one sitting on the case, but not specifically in the charger. These are definitely noise canceling, so at home I can hear my surroundings if I’m only using one of them. I am an audiobook fanatic, so I can feed my addiction with these. Did I mention how comfortable they are? Oh yes, no ear fatigue with these.

When playing music using the Apple Music app or watching YouTube videos, on occasion the sound will drop out in one bud or start to sound staticky as if there is some sort of interference. This happens if I’m either across a room or right next to the devices. I have changed settings in the Headphones app so that the buds prioritize a stable connection over sound quality (a tip I picked up from a post made on Reddit), however even after doing so the connection is still not stable.As for the rest of the package, I get about 4 hours of usage with each charge when listening at reasonable volume, and the charge case gives me on average 4 recharge cycles before having to plug it into a charger.I’ve found that after some use that I need to clean out the case using a dry cotton swab to remove any skin oils that are picked up by the buds, which then accumulate in the charge case after several uses.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AFNYUWQYSYNRYOYTBUSQW4G2NJZQ,True,0,Color: Black

They sound great, fit and feel great, work well (some minor issues with connectivity. Just the occasional hiccup. No worse than any other wireless device). Would be the perfect buds, but as I later learned and read elsewhere they tend to have a battery issue at around the 1 year mark. Mine started decreasing around 8 months. Missed my warranty by a few weeks by the time I reached out to Sony when I was only maxing out with about 40 minutes on a full charge. Pretty cold, AI like customer service. (I had a similar problem with a set of Bose who replaced my buds with an even better pair, never even asking when purchased. Perhaps I should have stuck with them?)In my mind earbuds well taken care of should last around 5 years. The battery death is really the only flaw with these, but that’s a HUGE problem. 5 stars if that wasn’t the case. Not 1 star because they are great otherwise.

My WH-1000XM5 over ear headphones at $400, now that's an amazing sound. However, for a nice walk or run they're okay.

I'll review the app and screenshots if I find any.App: I'm not thrilled that I had to connect via their app. However, I haven't tried disconnecting them either. The one thing I couldn't stand from their app is the Talk setting. Makes sure that's off when listening to music or otherwise your heavy breathing, a slight cough will pause the music and that's annoying.Battery: I've used these a for a few days and every time I come back from a walk they go right back in the case. So battery life isn't a problem for me right now. Nor would I worry about it. Unless you're on a two day hike in the Sahara with out an outlet. Then I'd start to worry.Price: To me, these plugs don't warrant the price. I think they're overly priced for what they are. Sony had wired in ear plugs back in the early 90s I think it was and those were 20x better than these. I believe they cost me around $29 I still have them somewhere in a box too.Final: I love Sony headphones. Always have. These aren't that great.

OTHER than that:NOISE CANCELLATION is incredible (e.g., mowing the lawn reduces the noise of the mower to a faint hum, in the gym you're basically working-out in a vacuum, and the noise cancellation can work on top of your music which wasn't always the case with buds). REFURBISHED doesn't always mean junk, there are reviews where people maybe had defective buds, not me, mine work just fine. SOUND is rich, deep bass, with very clear vocals and mids. They are not quite AS rich as the Bose, however, the sound on these are worth every penny- aweome sound! I had a pair of the new Bose but returned them as they are rather large/bulky for 2022 buds- the Sony's are very small. WATER PROOF, my last JBL's died likely because of my workouts and some moisture over 4 years of continuous use.

ANC is not good enough to me.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2023",AHBEONZYQRY4X6GJX4XRF3HUL2EQ,True,1,Color: Earth Blue

R2AGO4S8P6WXWB,B0BB5VBFRF,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good but could be better,NH,4,"Sony is going in the right direction with these but they are not flawless. I find they are fairly comfortable and reasonably easy to get a good noise canceling seal with good performance, but it's very easy to lose the seal if you are active while wearing them. I find they require a lot of adjustment while walking or running, and this is somewhat annoying compared to other earbuds that lack noise canceling but seal pretty well for me. I had some trouble with them falling out but not as much as just maintaining the noise canceling seal. This will depend on your ear shape though, so as long as the shape works for you these are great.The LinkBuds S support SBC, AAC, and LDAC when connected to an Android phone. Bluetooth LE Audio with the LC3 codec is supposed to be added in an update which could be one of the first headphones to support the new codec but at the time of my review this feature is not available yet.Sound quality is decent but I found it still sounds too compressed regardless of codec choice with an Android phone as the source. The larger WF-1000XM4 does sound better and has slightly better noise canceling assuming a similarly good seal, but these are significantly more comfortable for me.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2022",AF4VH6EN5CG4PDVDIU3RK6GOYH5A,True,0,Color: White

I was always cramming my previous earbuds back in my ears - they just never felt like they were going to stay put.I also really like that it stays paired to both my work iPhone and my personal use Android phone.

R3LHD0MFP4GWO1,B0BB5VBFRF,1.0 out of 5 stars Faulty firmware updates,Tyler T,1,"These were the best earbuds I've ever owned before I updated the firmware. This is the only set of earbuds that ever felt completely comfortable to me. The noise cancelling was impressive for earbuds. The ambient sound was excellent, especially if you're on a flight, train, etc listening for announcements. The sound quality was exceptional as well. Call quality and microphone noise cancelling was incredible! I could wear these in the garage next to a straight piped (no silencing or smog equipment) engine being revved up loud enough to hurt people ears and the only thing the microphone picked up was my voice.The application allows for even more control of the earbuds and gives you many additional options to tinker with.So why is it 1 star? After about a year of use I was still using these daily and would get about 3 hours of battery life, give or take depending on use case. I updated to the latest firmware and I now hear the low battery warning after 5 minutes and the earbuds will entirely shut off within LESS than 10 minutes. There is no way to roll back the firmware at the moment, any many others have reported similar issues after updating the firmware. Also many have been told by Sony it's a battery age issue and denied replacement.Going from 3 hours to 5 minutes does not happen to batteries overnight. Updating the firmware somehow caused this and Sony has not fixed it. I have tried resetting the device as well as a variety of other troubleshooting attempts with zero results. These are now reduced to little more than a paperweight, which, given their lightweight nature means they are also bad at that.Do not buy until Sony resolves the firmware issue and if you did buy them, do NOT update your firmware.","Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2024",AF6ALGCQDBJBQVT3UC3TPRHQLWVQ,True,2,Color: Earth Blue

I honestly barely notice they're there sometimes, I've almost gotten in the shower with them in 3 times since buying them this last month.I'm not crazy on noise canceling in general, I use it for hearing protection when I'm using power tools like grinders and sds drills and they definitely work better than ear plugs, they also manage to not get dusty somehow during rough in work. Mowing the lawn I can clearly listen to podcasts without missing what someone says. But I suppose if you're REALLY that worried about it you could get some foam ear tips, but I suspect that would ruin their perfect comfort.And while I've dropped them twice, I'm partially convinced that they're so light the impact doesn't induce as much shock.They're incredibly comfortable, sound great, I recharge the case every other night (I'll never understand people who complain about a 24hr case charge), and I got them for $150... Half what I paid for my now beat up after a year wf-1000xm4's.I think I've fallen in love with the midrange option. Highly recommend.

R2LGS9BJ69X9LX,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars So far so good,Sam H,5,"I finally ended up with these earbuds after a nightmare journey having traded in my perfectly great Samsung (first series) earbuds for the new Samsung buds pro 2, which it turned out I am totally allergic to and couldn't even wear for 10 minutes without getting a severe reaction, shame on you Samsung, they know they have a big problem and refused to return and refund me the buds.So here the journey starts, and shout out to Best Buy who took back and refunded every pair I bought! As I mostly listen to audio books in the night, and I'm a side/front sleeper, I needed them to be small and comfortable to lie on, as I'd just wasted over $200 on the Samsung buds, I thought I'd try cheaper ones so bought JBL 235NC earbuds, it was my first time wearing an earbud similar to Apple and for me I didn't like it, I also found the buds sound to be a bit tinny. So they went back and Idid some research and upped my spend and bought the Sony WF1000XM5, these had excellent reviews but the $300 purchase price hurt and they were big in my ears, definitely not comfortable to lay on and for me not worth the price, they went back, next I tried the beats studio buds +, these were ok, they are pretty small but have a raised piece that you hold to fit in your ear and I really struggled every time to put them in my ear, it was also tricky to get them in and out of the case, the sound was good and as much as I didn't really like them, I decided to keep them, until one fell out on the airplane and I couldn't find it, so I was back in the earbud market again and this whole time kicking myself for trading in my old Samsung earbuds, which were perfectly good. I will say that I didn't get a reaction to any of the new earbuds I tried - except the new samsung pro 2 - and now I'm running out of options, my husband said to try the Anker Soundcore A40s as he heard they were good and similar to the Samsung ones so for $50, I decided to give them a try, I read the reviews and supposedly they can be hit and miss, but if you get a bad one send it back and they will send a new pair.I bought a white pair and my first impression was they are good quality, the case seems sturdy and the buds look expensive. They look very similar to the Samsung earbuds in size, shape and appearance. I downloaded the app, and they paired straight away, they supplied a wide range of sizes of ear tips for fit and a huge choice of sound options, I did the ear test and went with their HearID sound option but there are lots of default choices as well as custom so you can adjust the sound to suit you. There is noise cancellation/Normal/Transparency mode options and I have to say it could be me but I didn't really notice a difference, the Samsung and Sony both have excellent noise cancelling if that is important, it's not really a problem for me. So far I'm pretty pleased, for the price point and quality I would highly recommend them, also for those of you who are struggling with reactions to their earbuds, so far these have been great","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2024",AGRPD2Q6DTDPJW6IFWYH3PYAKUQA,True,113,Color: White
R1RPHYJZO2B4TG,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Ear Buds at most any price!,michigan968,5,"I have to say I was skeptical given the cost but I was very wrong as these have been nothing other than great. I have purchased Bose ear buds that connect then2 pieces by wire, miscellaneous less expensive ear bud brands but thes A40 have are quite the best. They stay secure in ear or as secure as possible without duck taping to head. They connect every time without fail unlike any other earbuds that I need to delete and re-syncing but by far is the fact that have outstanding sound quality. Perhaps an audiophile could go into detail about things but they sound just as good as my $300 Bose headphones.I rarely write reviews but I had to comment because they are one of the best purchase I have made of this type. They recently went on a 2 week trip to Italy and again, no problems at all as I could wear just one while navigating streets in Venice while receiving navigating instructions. Can lay on the pillow with minimal discomfort and they have crazy battery life. I still have to work on adjusting the foam insert size but even out of box it was fine and more importantly, no pain or hot spots.I have no problem spending money on quality and to me these are near perfect and cost is just a bonus.

R3B8PP8DI73ZL5,B0B1LVC5VZ,"4.0 out of 5 stars A solid budget choice, with caveats.",Warren,4,"Pros:* Solid battery life. Got through a full 40-hour week of work on a single charge. The battery was almost entirely spent at that point but it made it.* These do a really good job isolating you from and cancelling outside noise. I work in a pretty noisy environment with lots of machines running. These tune out most of that sound very effectively, leaving behind only a dull clatter. They're not perfect at blocking out coworkers talking loudly but they definitely turn the volume down on it. I can't make out what they're saying and I'm left barely aware they're talking most of the time.* Solid build quality. Anker always does a great job in that regard.* Buds are relatively small and unobtrusive while still being easy to remove and insert.* Value for money. These are very impressive for the price.Cons:* The default EQ setting is hot garbage. I have no idea what they were thinking. Everything is turned down except low bass, which overwhelms everything else. It's like trying to listen to music when you've got a cold and your ears are stuffed up. It's awful.I managed to strike a balance I'm fairly happy with by creating a custom EQ using the treble booster setting. I left the highs and mids alone and dropped the two lowest frequencies a bit more. These sound pretty good when configured that way. However, this brings me to my next con:* You can't EQ the lowest bass frequencies enough. There's always a heavy thump when bass hits, even with it turned down to the maximum of -6dB on the EQ. If you don't like a lot of bass then these are a bad pick for you. I don't love it but it does work well in some music.* The controls don't seem to get along well with the gloves I wear at work. I've never had that issue with earbuds before, including several other pairs that also used touch controls. The left one seems to handle it okay but the right one misses some presses. It can be frustrating when I need to pause an audiobook to talk to someone.* The ANC can get a little wonky sometimes if you take the buds out and put them back in. I'm guessing it's something to do with the microphones. It's pretty easy to fix, though, by just toggling the ANC. I keep that bound to the controls for easy access anyway.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AFIAIMETZ2SV52KDEGAQBX7GAHMA,True,4,Color: White
RV9TWYNYJDR6Q,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars I have tried ALL THE EARBUDS and these are the closest to the Galaxy Buds +.,americayay,5,"I've been a longtime user of the Galaxy Buds +. I loved them. They fit comfortably and securely, had great battery life, sounded decent enough to a non-audiophile, and came in fun colors. They were also discontinued in 2021. I haven't found anything comparable since and didn't want to spend $90 on used earbuds guaranteed to be at least two years old. I assumed it would be easy enough to find something similar. My stars was I WRONG.The Galaxy Buds Pro 2 were my first and the most obvious choice. Sadly, they just didn't fit securely and the ANC was basically non-existent. The silicone of the Buds + literally dampened sound better. The case was needlessly large, as well, though that's not something that would have been a deal breaker. Fit was, however, and for $200, I needed to know these weren't going to fall out.The Sony WF-1000XM4 were next. I barely got them out of the box before deciding they were going back. They were HUGE and HEAVY.The Bose Sport Earbuds weren't as bad as the Sony WF-1000XM4, but they were still too big for me. I didn't hate the fit, but it wasn't great. I also wanted something reasonably subtle and these just weren't.For a moment, I thought the Sony Linkbuds S were a winner. They were comfortable, though they didn't fit as securely as I'd hoped. The ANC was great. I liked the blue, even if they didn't look as high-end as I'd like. They went back, however, when I realized the battery life was grossly exaggerated. I needed 10 hours and got four.The Sony WF-C500 had a better battery life, but didn't fit well and were made of cheap looking plastic. They had no ANC, which was fine, but for $100, I expected a better fit and nicer overall appearance.The Fitness Earbuds by Raycon were the biggest disappointment. Despite the negative reviews from self-proclaimed audiophiles, I loved these. They were ALMOST as comfortable as the Galaxy Buds + and, though they didn't look as nice, they came in fun colors. The case was tiny and discreet. I was even ready to buy a backup pair... until I realized they weren't disconnecting from my phone when I put them in the case, which meant they also weren't charging. After reading reviews, I discovered this was a frequent issue with no fix. Many people even reported having the issue months later, so I suppose I was lucky and could still return them.The Liberty 3 Pro were my final failed attempt. They fit securely, but stuck out of my ears awkwardly. They weren't terribly uncomfortable, but they definitely weren't something I could have worn all day, either. They did sound great and the ANC was amazing, but I needed something smaller, subtler, and more suitable for extended wear.Finally, I've landed on the Space a40, after trying ALL THE EARBUDS. They're almost perfect. I wasn't expecting to get as secure a fit as the Galaxy Buds + without wingtips, but these feel ALMOST exactly the same. They are a TAD BIT looser. As a stay-at-home mom, I wear them all day long, between audiobooks, music, and just employing ANC to drown out toddler tantrums. The battery life is epic. They look higher end than any of the above choices. They sound great to this non-audiophile and have an especially user-friendly app.I do find it frustrating that I apparently can't add two of the same brand of earbuds to the app, but that's honestly fine, because I don't use it for any reason other than reprogramming the touch controls, which I don't need to do often. I will say that the ANC is alright, but not as impressive as some of the chunkier earbuds I've tried. The earbuds and case are both fairly small and discreet, so it's not immediately obvious that I'm wearing them. At $80, the Space a40 earbuds cost less than refurbished Galaxy Buds +. I bought them in white and blue.After I got my second pair, I realized there was an echo on the receiving end of my phone calls. Some of the reviews stated similar issues or mentioned coming in at low volume. I didn't have this problem with my initial pair, so I returned the defective ones. The next pair was absolutely fine. So, if you're having mic issues, there's something wrong with your specific earbuds. Just exchange them. The same goes for feedback. I returned another pair for the occasional buzzing noise and didn't have the same problem with the other.I was a little disappointed that despite the popularity and rave reviews of these earbuds, I couldn't find a custom leather case. I wanted to keep the charging case nice when I tossed them in my purse, though, and tried several options. I settled on this leather zipper pouch from Hide and Drink, which measures 5""×3"" and fits almost perfectly. It also comes in blue to match my earbuds. I've even added a Tile so I can find them in the microwave of the toy kitchen, when necessary.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2023",AEDS6CB7ABZRENLVAQK3W3GPGZMQ,True,340,Color: White
R1BBN683X4W3U9,B0B1LVC5VZ,"3.0 out of 5 stars Pretty great, but with a MAJOR problem",Lady Geranium,3,"THINGS I LOVE:I'm impressed with the sound quality, noise cancellation, comfort, and customizable touch commands on these earbuds. Of course the sound quality won't match top-of-the-line over-ear headphones and you won't get studio sound, but these are pretty darn solid in terms of sound quality. Crisp and full. I use these on the subway and the noise-cancelling is enough that I can keep the volume at a comfortable level—rather than cranking the volume up like I did on my old AirPods. There are multiple noise-cancelling modes and you can even turn noise-cancelling off if it freaks you out. Overall, I'm very happy with how these sound.They also come with every size of ear tips so you can get a snug but comfy fit. The intuitive accompanying app is not necessary, but I used it to customize touch commands to raise/lower volume, skip ahead or back, and play/pause. Really simple to use, and easy to create gestures that make sense for your use case.Battery life is pretty amazing too. I got these a few weeks ago, charged up the case, and haven't had to charge it again yet. These aren't my main headphones, but I've used them almost every day for walks, errands, exercise, and commuting. Very impressive battery life so far.They've also been pretty tolerant of exercise sweat, though I will say that they were acting possessed for an hour after getting sweaty. These were more comfortable and sound-immersive than my old AirPods for workout music, but my AirPods held up better to sweat. These still win for me in that category, though, because of the ANC and the fact that they didn't fall out of my head and go flying off the treadmill belt underneath me.So mostly, I love these.THE MAJOR PROBLEM, THOUGH:Now, the flaw—which would be a dealbreaker if these weren't only $60 and such a dream otherwise—THESE ARE UNUSABLE FOR CALLS. I actually CANNOT use them for phone calls. The audio quality sounds ""underwater"" as my friends and family put it over the phone, and my audio quality tests yield the same results.Even worse, they randomly stop sending my audio signal every seven or eight minutes. So I'll pick up the phone while out for a walk, talk with poor audio quality for a few minutes, and then the person on the other end of the line suddenly does the whole ""Ohp, I think you cut out—you there? Hello? Can you hear me?"" And I need to switch my audio source to my phone, then back to the headphones. This happens every few minutes for the entire call. It's such a pain that I can't put myself or phone friends through it anymore. I don't even talk on the phone often, but this is a big enough problem that I might have to replace these.One of the reasons I bought these was to have reliable earbuds for work calls and phone calls, but these don't work for those scenarios. It's really too bad, because these are SO GREAT (especially for the price) otherwise.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AEKPYUNOBWEHADEISC5RMGCYVKGA,True,7,Color: White
RWHATU9UJRIHX,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Almost a year with these buds - SPECTACULAR!,Randy Browning,5,"Final update - the right earbud issue has yet to repeat, so that's not an issue. As I've said, I have four other top end earbuds, and the only pair I use is the Soundcore A40. We have a little land and a John Deere Z920M zero turn, and its loud. My neighbors all have the same mower, and all wear headsets. I now won't mow without my A40's, as the noise cancelling is even better than my 1 month old top end hearing aids (thanks VA).The sound is not like you're sitting in a studio listening to an album on a top end everything audio, but nothing is, so when people try comparing buds to studio headsets, I just smile. The sound is crazy good for a couple of marble sized devices that connect via a rf signal. Darn amazing.Update - I submitted a warranty claim, due to the right earbud not being active when I started this morning, but I decided to put them back into the charge case for a few minutes and it came to life. Here's to hoping this is not a new trend? Still love their sound quality, and general fitment. I have noticed that they have started to come loose when I'm bent over working in the heat. I've been tempted a couple times to buy new buds, but these are still very hard to beat.Over the last two months I've tried several earbud, all were horrible failures. These are different. Shortly after I got them I headed from N. FL to Delta Junction AK. So 9 total hours in the air both directions. While there I spent 5+ hours a day running a chainsaw, a stump grinder, and a commercial wood chipper, all while using the noise cancellation (N/C).I never ran out of battery life while running N/C, although once I left the first leg of my flights, I did put them back in the case, so each leg they were returned to full charge. Only once did I have one come lose from my right ear, and it did not fall out. Before I left I'd use them to run my John Deere commercial mower for the two hours it takes to mow the yard, and they were awesome at cutting out motor noise.Wear - With the correct tips they work flawlessly. They have a fit process called Real Ear ID (or something like that). The testing will determine the best fit and seal by running those tonal sounds you're used to in hearing test booths. I was never able to get a passed or perfect fit according to the test, and I did try three sets of the foam tips (these did not work in my ears, and they did not allow the buds to charge in the case). As I said they stay in your ears.Charging - The case is small and give you a full charge in well under an hour. There are only 3 led charge indicator lights, and I've never had less than 3 lights. The case also has the USB-C type charging port, unlike half of the other buds I tried, which still had micro USB. There are no good case covers that I found on Amazon, but I bought a soft case cover and it works ok, where I'd rather have a hard cover.Touch control - the app allows you to change the function of single, double, triple touch, and long hold. The touch is responsive, and accurate.Wear - Possibly a kind of repeat, as I've discussed fit, but I wanted to cover comfort. I do not get wear fatigue.Sound and volume - The sound is easily as good as my Samsung Ear Buds Pro with much better battery life. Volume seems to be a problem with most earbuds, but not these. I'm older with hearing loss, and like to listen to my music louder than is comfortable for most. I end up around 45% of volume for regular listening, and around 70% they become too loud, but the sound is still clear and crisp.The App - It is simple, but complete, with EQ function.I've finally found a set that I'll keep.","Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2023",AGKUW63O2WVYHXMVZ4M3WUCJ77FA,True,87,Color: White
RDDBZZTO4PFT,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect buds for me,Ski9,5,"Okay, my review is not really needed, especially as yet another 5-star review, but I'm not gonna knock a star just so my opinion gets some attention. This product deserves my stars and my gratitude. I don't have a lot of $ and my gratitude is for getting super quality at an affordable price. These look beautiful, feel awesome, and most important, sound really great. That last part surprised me to be honest. I mean I know it gets good reviews but in the past, buds or headphones that others rave about were just ""meh"" for me, nothing special. I wasn't sure if I just did not have refined ears to appreciate the quality, of if I was just too picky and critical. Well it seems to be the latter. I have super sensitive ears and I suffer when the sound quality is not great, especially with buds. This is the case not just for music but even speech. I listen to a lot of podcasts and if the sound quality isn't good then I tend to not listen to that series again. Of course to a big extent that depends on the production (same with music) and also the voice the speaker is blessed with (or not), but given a good production, having good buds or headphones is super important for me. And these buds DEFINITELY sound really great for either music or spoken speech. With music especially, I could judge and appreciate them right away because I listened to a track I have listened to since I was a little kid. I know this track and its sounds! With other equipment, the consonant sounds can sound either muffled, or at the other extreme, harsh and grating. With these buds the sound is perfect -- I can distinguish the sounds clearly and yet they are smooth and relaxing to listen to. Smooth and relaxing and pleasant is a good way to describe the sound.As far as the looks and size, they are perfect. I was worried at first about the ear tips because they all seemed kind of small. I'm a small person with fairly small ears but the shape of my ear hole is wide and I tend to need the larger tips. However, the part that reaches into your ear is not just the tip but the hard plastic part too. They seem to be very expertly ear-shaped. So even the smaller tip may end up fitting well because it is in a deeper, narrower part of your ear. This is good I think because the buds are less likely to fall out. This is because part of the body of the bud is deeper in your ear, rather than the bulk (and therefore weight) of it being outside. This helps with comfort because the tip does not need to be so tight to hold the buds in. Also, there are 5 choices for size of tip, and they vary both in width and depth, and they are thin and therefore very flexible. So you are very likely to get a comfortable fit. Overall they are extremely well designed.The app is good too. This is my 2nd Soundcore purchase, and the first one was over-ear headphones. You add the model to the app, and the features depend on the particular model, and may vary a lot. The features and options seem pretty good for this model. And the little quick start manual (paper included in box and also readily accessible from the app) are appreciated. There is also good support on the web site, including instruction videos for some of the more complex features. My only complaint is the ""sound test"" which was not as good and refined as other buds I've had. And it was too loud, and at least on my phone I could not adjust the volume during the test. But this could improve with app updates.ANC works great, as do the other settings. One thing I especially appreciate is there is little noise/hum when the music isn't playing, which is not the case with other ANC buds I've tested. Sometimes I just want quiet, no music, and block out noise, and if there is static or other noise then that annoys and distracts and stresses me. But these are quiet (and more comfortable than wearing ear buds, and work better for blocking noise). So it meets my needs perfectly. I've only had them for a little while but if there are any issues that arise, I will update the review.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AFBJA3YWUUXZPIWS2CEAGKVPIM7Q,True,60,Color: Blue
RC5UVXFXNSDKH,B0B1LVC5VZ,4.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones but they often fall out of my ears,Weston,4,I love these headphones they have the best battery out of all of the headphones i’ve ever used. I love how quick they are to pair to other devices and I love the fact you can have 2 devices at once so you can easily switch between them. I love fact that you can adjust the tone of the headphones using the app. I personally like a deeper sound to my music but I can easily adjust it in the app. It’s very simple to use. The things I didn’t like about the headphones were that they will slowly fall out of my ears often. My last headphones had a wing tip design so they would stay in my ears better. Also the touch sensor would often activate when I pick up the headphones out of the case. It would often skip tracks or activate the noise cancellation mode. And the noise cancellation mode would often give me headaches.It felt like it was putting a lot of pressure on my ears when I used it.,"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AF54Y5KMJOK324P4M2OAVI2ZVRCQ,True,4,Color: Black
R3FQQNI1AV6O72,B0B1LVC5VZ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Top Tier ANC, Excellent Sound, and Pretty Decent call quality",Daea,4,"Last two photos are of the damage from me dropping them (after call quality section for height)I will list the features in this review from my favorite/imo best qualities at the price. Also below are the codes (limited time) for 20% off these amazing buds.20% Limited Discount From 08/25/22-09/07/22US: FORSPACEUSUK: FORSPACEUKDE: FORSPACEDECA: FORSPACECAAPP- The app for any soundcore product out there is simply a delight to use. Intuitive UI, superb features, and excellent help. Features may vary by earbud but these have 2 modes with different strengths of ANC, 2 modes for transparency, wind reduction, custom EQ, Hear ID (for people with frequencies they cant hear as well), 22 preset EQ's, customizable controls for 1 tap, 2 tap, and 2 sec press, Gaming/low latency mode, and even allows you to test the fit of your eartips. Generally one of the best apps out there in my opinion.APP overall- 10/10APP for price- 10.5/10ANC(For reference, I have excellent hearing, as of last hearing test about 3 months ago, and am noise sensitive to even decently loud things)- The ANC on these earbuds is phenomenal, some cheaper earbuds may have white noise like a humming or slight ring etc when used with no music or sound, but these are nearly dead silent when used without sound and in only ANC mode. The quality and diversity of the ANC is excellent and, although not as good as the liberty 3 pros or some more expensive earbuds (missing the mark by a hair in some/most cases), these are a real treat for anyone who loves ANC. Just perfect ANC for the price and the adaptive feature (soundcore app), although not personally my favorite to use (I prefer to leave it on strong), still works phenomenally. It blocks out a large amount of noise and dulls most others so that they are easy to tune out or at least not overly annoying if they are quite loud. Did notice that on sharp, sudden, and loud sounds they do make a pop sound on occassion. However this has only happened when I weedwack larger malberry branches or accidentally hit a pole or something metallic or solid. Altogether I would say it is easily one of the best and comparable ANC performances on earbuds I have heard yet, particularly for the price.Overall ANC- 9.2/10For price ANC- 10/10Sound Quality/VolumeCAUTION- this is without LDAC enabled cause I have and IPhone and sound will be even better (Hypothetically) with and LDAC (available for any phone sporting an Android Oreo 8.0 operating system and above)- The sound quality is excellent on these earbuds, considering the size especially, (beating my Airpods Gen 2 by a mile). The soundstage (depth of distance of sound and its components) is wonderful one of my favorite parts of the sound experience. Treble and highs sound great and not overbearing unless you like a great deal of bass, they reach and sparkle amazingly well for such a compact design and in general. the mids are stunning, the control and out of the box mids were great, an area that a lot of my other earbuds skip a tad for more bass or smoother treble, however these are one of the best sounding mids on a (semi)budget earbud I can find. The subass and bass are definately lacking for any basshead or decent bass enjoyer out of the box, however it can be boosted (either using hear ID or the EQ options) to satisfy and usual enjoyer with the bass, may still be a tad low for bassheads. An all around sounding earbud that has amazing sound performance and is one of the best BALANCED earbuds I've used. The volume is way to loud for me at max or even close, I listen at about 40-45 percent volume for a louder listening experience, although subjective I have read/found that these go to about 113.6 decibles AKA way to loud for me, but should be fine unless you have hearing damage or really like to rock out.Basshead Sound Quality/Volume- 8.75/10Overall Sound Quality/Volume- 9.0/10For price Sound Quality/Volume- 9.84/10Transparency- The transparency modes on this are admittedly not so natural sounding as some more expensive brands, but they do allow you to hear extremely well. The modes are fully transparent and Vocal mode, I have seen some people say that the Vocal mode isn't to their taste and that they keep it on fully transparent, however I always keep it on vocal mode, it accents voices and dims background noise very well in my opinion. Each mode sounds slightly tinny, but only at times and with either a large amount of different sounds or very loud sounds. All in all the transparency is in an excellent position for the price, beating nearly all competition in the price range.Overall Transparency- 9.0/10For price Transparency- 9.75/10Fit/ComfortCAUTION - This section is a seperate scheme to the listing from best to worse since I have a biological/genetic bias of smaller ears than averageThese fit MY ears very well and the range of eartips provided is phenomenal, 5 sets ranging from xs to xl, I use the default Mediums and they fit my ears like a glove (Don't forget the earfit test). These passed the most rigorous headbanging/shaking/jostling...etc that I could put them through without giving myself wiplash and they stayed in like a champ, hardly even budging. I can leave these in with transparency on and they feel very naturally shaped to MY ear, and seem to have a curvature inspired by the curves of your ear. I cant really say anythin else except that they are small, comforteable, and by proxy not very noticeable. Remember that they are small and sizes/comfort are subjective, would still recommend to most people, especially with small ears. Just maybe not if you have very large ears.Overall Fit/Comfort- 9.4/10 -SubjectiveFor price Fit/Comfort- 9.8/10 -SubjectiveCall Quality- Unfortunately this is where it drops the cake a bit, although the noise cancelling on the calls is superb (compareable to Liberty 3's) the sound on your voice is less natural and not as good as a select variety of earbuds for similar/slightly higher prices. It still is good and even greatish for calls but is not amazing or gonna wow anyone. And realize that the earbuds are newer on the market so they will most likely get software updates over this or other features later down the road.Overall Call Quality- 7.75/10For price Call Quality- 7.95-8.1/10Durability note- I dropped these from about 5 feet 6 inches (1.67 meters) off the ground and the earbuds didnt fall out and the case took one to two small scratches and maintained the coloration perfectly fine.

R1V73ERKHRL92E,B0B1LVC5VZ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Fine for the price, a couple of issues",Patrick E.,4,"First, I would definitely buy these again if I needed an inexpensive set of bluetooth earbuds with conference call capability. The sound quality is great, and I have been able to easily pair them to various devices including an iPhone, an Android, and a Chromebook. I did not want to spend hundreds more, and these have been well reviewed.I did not give five stars for two reasons:1. The noise cancellation on these is (in my opinion) mediocre at best. I have used them in various settings including walking on a busy city street, working around yard machinery, and being in an airplane. The noise cancellation, whether on their Adaptive mode or manually set to High Noise, was completely overwhelmed by the yard machinery. On city streets, they were good enough for me to hear voices. On the airplane, they are mostly fine but definitely do not cancel as much noise as over-the-ear headphones I have used. Then again, that may be a factor of the tiny size.2. The app lets you customize what happens when tap, double-tap, or tap/hold either earbud. There are some useful actions on there, like Play/Pause, but some are also missing. For example: Mute/Unmute Mic, immensely useful in conference calls, or Volume Up/Down. If Soundcore/Anker added options to the tap control settings, that would be really useful.On the plus side, these ship with four extra sets of ear tips of different sizes. I tested a couple of different sizes and found one that gives me a really good, comfortable fit.The app offers customizations including mode (Noise Reduction, off, or Ambient pass-through), sound profiles (equalization) and more. The case charges the buds when you put them in the case and close the lid. I have worn the buds for several conference calls and been outside listening to podcasts and music, and they both charge quickly and don't deplete the case battery all that much. So far I have not had concerns about taking them ""on the road"" for a couple of days without a charging cable. The charging port is USB-C, so cables are plentiful - and one day when we see even the company with a bitten fruit logo adopt USB-C, we may finally get down to one cable!Anyway, as mentioned above I would buy these again if I needed an inexpensive, capable set of bluetooth earbuds with conference call capability and good sound quality. The bass is quite good for music, though I do find myself needing to adjust them periodically when moving around.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AETVEIDMNUZ2CT7RAVUPF24HPXCA,True,1,Color: Black
R2SJR0HOFDAO6K,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars They sound great and have tons of available adjustments for those that like to fine-tune,Tenderfoot56,5,"If you want a really nice pair of earbuds, consider these Anker Space A40 noise canceling wireless earbuds. For the price I don't think you can beat them. The case is pretty small and fits nicely in a pocket or purse and the earbuds come with five different size rubber cones that you can change on the tips of the earbuds until you find one that is comfortable for your ear. The earbuds allow you to control volume up and down, next song, play and pause, and also change the different modes of noise canceling that best fits your situation using the touch sensitive surfaces of each earbud. They're advertised at being able to perform for about 10 hours between charges, and the charging case has enough power to charge the earbuds four times. The application for the phone has tons of adjustments that you can make to the sounds and management of the earbuds through the touch sensors in addition to being able to connect to two separate Bluetooth devices at the same time for example you could connect to your cell phone and your computer or in my case I connect to my cell phone and my Amazon fire stick in the bedroom so I can watch TV at night without bothering my bride. They've been in production for a couple of years and they've pretty much worked out all the bugs. Some YouTube videos have described them as one of the best sets of earbuds you could buy for under $100 and that was 2 years ago! I think I paid under $50 for these on Amazon.

RS0AB1WJLJK3,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Never thought I could wear ear buds,Beachreader,5,"Maybe it's just me, but I never liked ear buds, wired or otherwise. Always fell out or hurt or something. I'd take the ones they give out on the airplanes and struggle to hear anything at all, pressing them in with my fingers while others around me seemed perfectly fine. OK, I know those are obviously terrible, but I tried other types when I could, and just figured I couldn't wear them, much less wireless ones. I bought some cheap over-ear headphones and figured I'd just have to deal with how awkward they were. I saw these ranked highly in Wirecutter, so I thought what the heck, I'd give them a try, and because Amazon, I could just return them if they didn't fit. Miraculously, they fit! And they fit really well. Somehow the way the hard part is structured sits in my ear cup and the soft part isn't shoved all they way into my skull. I still need to figure out some controls, and the app isn't super intuitive for beginners, but I've been able to comfortably listen to a book or music on my commute, and it's really been great. Commute is about an hour at a time and I've used them five or six trips and the case still shows three lights, so I guess the battery lasts a long time. Maybe the more expensive ones would be even better, but I'm happy with these so far!","Reviewed in the United States June 21, 2024",AE6KEHR46HLJKDWWH55ONN53DYPA,True,0,Color: Blue

It’s crazy. I will say it doesn’t go as loud as I would like it to go. Occasionally my gym is packed and super loud and I want them louder, but more often than not I’m listening at little under 3/4 of the Max volume. Bluetooth connectivity is wonderful I have never had issues with being out of range. Performance is good. I have used to wash my car and for some reason they fell out a couple times. At the gym they never fall out but I would not snowboard in these unless I had a beanie over my ears holding them in better. I have an odd fit in my ears, because many times I’ve experienced ear buds not fitting properly. I have to press them in a lot which skips a song. But if I learned the functions better I could really enjoy that feature.

The sound quality has been great so far and they are easy to connect to my devices. The only issue is that I have to turn fr the Bluetooth on my iPad if I want to use these with my iPhone and vice-versa and when I have been listening to music on my iPhone, it randomly pauses which is annoying.

R39SQN8ACMTUXF,B0B1LVC5VZ,4.0 out of 5 stars My first pair of earbuds,Gems54,4,"I was looking for a pair of earbuds in the less that $100 range to enjoy music when I take walks and maybe use at work sometimes. These won out over others I tried. I ordered and returned several other brands that had good ratings, that people said were comfortable but returned because I did not find them to be comfortable in my ears. I decided to keep the Soundcore as I was able to get a decent fit in my small ears. I like how they sit in the shape of your ear and they don't have a stem. Every so often I have to adjust one or both but I don't wear them all day, only for like an hour at a time.The sound quality is decent, not as great as some others I tried, but not bad. I feel like I am listening to the radio rather than stereo sound but for what I was looking for I am fine with it. The controls work as they should about 90& of the time. Sometimes I have to tap and tap and tap again to get the controls to move to the next song. If there is even one strand of hair over the earbud it seems to not take the tap which is annoying. And it seems as though you can only jump to the next song so many times, then it does not allow you to skip after you have hit that number which I feel is a dumb feature. I usually have to stop the music and start again to restart that skip max. The battery life so far has been very good.Overall, because these earbuds can stay in my ears and not be uncomfortable while I exercise or walk and they fit my price point, they were worth keeping as my first pair of earbuds. Someday I may upgrade but for now they came out on top of other options on the market.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AE6K4FLOMOBX3RQ5KG2JCAFOOMNQ,True,0,Color: White

I thought these would be good to use with my riding mower and I can say it's night and day vs other earbuds. I think I've used them for about 60hrs now and I think I've only charged the case 1 time which is also impressive.

R17TCV8DBIA7V6,B0B1LVC5VZ,4.0 out of 5 stars Good earbuds but sound quality leaves some to be desired,Caitlin Bautista,4,"I've been using the same TOZO earbuds for 2 years and decided to buy these earbuds for these reasons: 1) longer battery life, 2) more options for sound modes, and 3) better connection with my iPhone. To give a little background, I primarily wear earbuds while working, commuting on the bus, and for personal use at home. But unfortunately, I decided to return the Soundcore earbuds for a few reasons. Continue reading below for my reasons why.Likes:1) I really like the sound quality options as well as the ability to adjust the sound quality, using the Soundcore app which I think is a definite must if you want more control over the sound quality. I've really enjoyed switching between the ANC & transparency modes as they are surprising modes I never realized I wanted. With TOZO, I could only wear 1 earbud when using them at work so I can still hear my surroundings. But with the Soundcore earbuds on transparency mode, I can wear both earbuds and still hear the ongoings around the office near my desk.2) The battery life is also a godsend in both the earbuds and the charging case. I don't think I fully realized when purchasing, how fast the earbuds would charge when in the case. At one point, I used the earbuds for 8 hours between ANC & transparency mode, charged the earbuds in the charging case for 15 minutes when I was on my break, and when I went to use them again afterward the earbuds were already 80-100% charged as according to my iPhone. Considering how often I use the earbuds after 8-10 hrs per day and 4-5 days of use from a full charge, the battery life is still 2 lights remaining which according to the Soundcore manual should be about 70-50% battery life remaining (I think that's the right range).3) After using the TOZO earbuds, I've grown to appreciate wireless charging which the Soundcore earbuds do so that's a plus. Much easier for me as I'm still unused to using a USB-C cable which the Soundcore earbuds do come with, but I just have not liked charging my earbuds with a cord as much.Dislikes:1) As much as I love the sound modes, I desperately need as much noise canceling as possible when using earbuds at home/commuting. So when I'm at home/commuting, I more often use the ANC mode on these earbuds. The audio setting does perform noise canceling well but these fall below the bar when I compare these earbuds to my TOZO earbuds which block out more noise than the Soundcore earbuds. I can cancel out more noise on the Soundcore earbuds by raising the volume under ANC mode. But as much as I would like to continue that method on the Soundcore earbuds, I value retaining my hearing as much as I can.2) Connection-wise for the Soundcore earbuds with my iPhone was good to a point. Connecting to my iPhone was no issue, it was some situations in retaining that connection when going about my day is the issue. I've found the audio connection for the Soundcore earbuds cuts off when I'm on the bus/car (don't worry I'm not the one who's driving). When the vehicle (bus/car) drives over a very bumpy road/highway, the audio cuts off in response until the vehicle is back onto a smoother road/highway. I've also noticed this connection issue when I'm walking around my apartment complex, specifically when I walk under and through a small hallway to enter between complex buildings (my apartment complex is primarily outdoors when navigating between complex buildings to access apartment units). I had this issue recently with my TOZO earbuds so I'm sad I'm already having this issue with the Soundcore earbuds right out of the box. Mind you, the Soundcore earbuds I received may be a previously returned set that was already opened.3) Receiving the Soundcore earbuds already opened dampened my experience with these earbuds early on. But I knew this was a familiar tactic that Amazon often does if the condition of the item is still almost good as new. So I tried to keep my fingers crossed that using the earbuds changed my mind since the earbuds still looked unused and had no residue of dirt on the earbuds themselves. I still cleaned the earbuds myself just in case, especially nowadays with the pandemic.Overall:The fact that qualities I liked with the TOZO earbuds were missing out for me when using the Soundcore earbuds (sound quality) and I started having the same issues with the Soundcore earbuds as I currently have with my TOZO earbuds (connection issue), this was big negative for me since I still wanted to retain that quality as this was a $99 purchase.But I still rated these earbuds 4 stars because I really liked the battery life which exceeded my expectations and I really liked the type of sound quality modes in tandem with the Soundcore app as it really helped me customize my experience day to day depending on what activity I'm doing (commuting or at work).","Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2022",AEMFP6TKJZ3QMSKNEQGFRDMSG4VQ,True,68,Color: White
RPW5L5QIIV7BJ,B0B1LVC5VZ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great performance, great price",Fern Lovebond,4,"These have been my introductory pair of noise-canceling earbuds, and I'm pretty impressed with how well they perform, considering the price point. I've had more expensive earbuds that didn't have ANC and didn't perform as well as this.The initial setup with the app went through a series of tests to determine my sensitivity in each ear, and while I can bypass the settings which account for this if I choose, but the sounds is better when I leave it enabled. That said, sometimes if I'm trying to really play my music loud, there will be some distortion, and either I have to adjust the EQ so far that it lacks bass, or I basically limit the output so much is as if I didn't turn it up in the first place. This is probably more my problem than the item's, tho. The ability to switch between noise canceling, normal, and transparent is very useful, since there are those occasions when it's preferable that I be capable of hearing my environment, and others when it's safe for me to block out the world. It has also been handy to be able to tweak how the controls function; I've adjusted then to allow more options, and to mimic the ones on my last pair of Bluetooth buds, which had become habit.The buds come with medium tips already attached, but there are 4 other sizes included (2 smaller, 2 larger) for getting the best fit. There is also a small USB (A to C) cable included for charging. The instruction manual is there if you need it, but the app will walk you thru everything, too, and is pretty obvious to navigate.TLDR: probably the best budget priced noise canceling buds you'll find.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AENWCRNOKJU24VSRXJTBQSJWAR7Q,True,4,Color: Black

It also has a transparency mode so you can hear people talking to you and not worry about needing to take them out.The app for SoundCore is great. You can update the firmware to enable LDAC for your music. Way cheaper than grabbing some expensive Sonys to get that feature.The other thing that is great, is that it is multi-point bluetooth. You can turn off LDAC and instead connect to 2 devices at once.If you have more than 2 devices you want to connect to, it will remember all your connections in the app, so you can turn one off and another on.

It really balances the sound to your personal hearing. No need to play with equalizers since the app does a great job there.Only gripe is that the battery life could use some work.

UGH.The earbuds feel very comfortable; can't say yet if they will stay in, which is my biggest concern with these tiny things, given the expense.Update: first day wearing, one popped out at work and rolled onto a conveyer belt. I was able to catch it, luckily, and it still works, but I'm going to return them, as the fit doesn't work for me. I'll try out the ""workout style"" for a more secure fit. The sound quality is excellent.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2024",AGVQHG2LDXPJO7UN4RRSDVGSZJGA,True,0,Color: Blue
RPEBCM1BLKAG7,B0B1LVC5VZ,4.0 out of 5 stars So far I'm loving these! Great replacement for Galaxy Buds,Jennifer M Forant,4,"These have the best noise cancelling I've ever experienced! So much so that I cannot hear someone talking to me and barely hear the phone ringing! I haven't quite found the right ear cushion size so they can feel a bit big if you have small ears. They slide in and sit very firmly although I probably wouldn't run with them. My galaxy buds routinely fall out which is how I've lost some and damaged others. They do not click off and on as easy as the Galaxy buds, and that is my only minus for these. I'm still having to trouble shoot the touch on and off as well as volume controls but it may get better.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFYFPELDOSL4UT5ZQGSTRCPR6GAA,True,0,Color: Blue

Are there earbuds that sound better or have better ANC and more features.? Sure, but they’re also much more costly. I’d even go with these over their more expensive options.

R126FGIQ75FTXV,B0B1LVC5VZ,4.0 out of 5 stars Going from Sony WF1000XM3 to these,Johnnie B,4,"The now dated Sony's served well for years. Sound quality was and still remains tops notch. I've mostly used these in short durations until I changed jobs that require a lot of travel. One of the big drawbacks is the bulk and relying solely on the ear insert to secure them on. Man, my ears hurt after about an hour of use. Needed something that provided more comfort. These Soundcores are much smaller, lighter and uses the ear bowl to support some of its weight. Much better for long-term use. Even the charging case is much smaller providing added portability.Sound quality does fall short. The Sony has a bigger Soundstage, deeper and cleaner bass. Makes the Soundcore sound slightly muffled compared to it. Still very satisfying for the average listener however, audiophiles would notice the difference. Then again, these shouldn't be considered by audiophiles. But for us ""bang for the buck""ers, it's a home run.ANC is also not as good as the Sony but 90 percent close.The sound quality and ANC does not detract a star. I knew going in that the Sony were superior in that regard but I am surprised how close this Soundcore got at 1/6 the price. The most recent Sony XM5 addresses my comfort issue but don't want to shell out near 300 bucks again.Other reviews had complaints about ear securement but I took the foam inserts from the Sony and using them on these so no issues here.The one star retract is the tap controls and lack of voice guidance. It would be helpful to know what I just did with the tap controls especially with ANC control. The delayed response to disconnecting from phone after you put these in the case is also annoying. Sony response was immediate. Nothing very significant but minor nuisances I didn't have to deal with on the Sony.IMO things:The piano mode was my favorite of the pre-sets but lacked bass. I took the piano profile and tried to replicate in custom mode with the low bass up max. Sounds pretty good.If you're considering Sony buds but may be leaning to the XM4 to save a few bucks, don't. There was a big jump in design change between XM4 and 5. I tried both and while the 4 is better than my 3, the 5 is fantastic with a much smaller profile without any sound compromises.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2024",AERMTFJ7XI6KSGMZ7ME3EQ4KMRVA,True,16,Color: Black
R3ECKOJZJI4G5K,B0B1LVC5VZ,4.0 out of 5 stars These are keepers!,Zig,4,"I tried some others and they just didn't fit. These have 5 sizes of ear tips, which helps a bunch to get a perfect fit! They sound great, and the noise cancelling modes are very useful. I like that I can turn on the transparency mode and it blocks out a lot of the music at my office but I can still hear people talking. Also, they're very effective for phone calls. I use mine while driving on the highway. Not only does the noise cancelling really quiet things down but it makes phone calls possible as my stereo and phone are both terrible at it.My only two complaints:1. when you put them in or adjust them you're very likely to hit one of the control buttons and change modes, start/stop the music, pause, etc...2. When changing noise cancelling modes, there's no indication of which one you're in, so I usually have to screw around with it until I find the one I want. This is especially true after putting them in and accidentally changing the mode - see issue #1, then rinse and repeat.3. When someone wants to talk to me I've had to take them completely out because it's a pain to stand there and try to find the right mode to talk to someone. Annoying, but not a deal breaker because I mostly use them while mowing, doing yardwork, long distance driving, and other solitary tasks.Your mileage may vary.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AEULZUT5TO2YV6VOTD23D7OEUPDA,True,0,Color: Black

Only thing that trips it up is wet hair, which it registers as a tap. Other than that, the sound quality is incredible, especially for the price point, and the battery life is great. I listen to music about 50 hrs per week and have to charge the case usually only once per week. In the box is 4 sizes of silicone ear attachments and so it was easy to find the size that fit my ears perfectly. The noise cancellation is good for most droning sounds and, for an earbud, effective. I appreciate the feature of being able and to control how much noise cancellation it does and also being able to change the balance of frequencies. I have mine set to bass boost and it's great. My other minor qualm is that if you drop the case with the earbuds in it from waist-height, it will likely open and the earbuds may bounce out. That's not a big deal since I don't drop it often and the magnetic mechanism holding the earbuds in and the case closed it very satisfying otherwise, but if you are prone to dropping things, you may want to get a silicone wrap for the case so this doesn't happen.Overall, I'd say that these earbuds are worth the $100 dollars I paid and more. They certainly compete with the more expensive equivalences at Bose and Sony. For context, I've been using these daily since I got them in Jan of 2024.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AE4HYLHU52Z5BRHOL5VGUJPRNKWQ,True,2,Color: Blue
R1OUFTTU58X7GB,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars TINY EARS A++++❤️,T$,5,"I bought these after googling “EarPods for tiny ears” and these were ranked #1 on various sites.I have unusually small ears, and have never been able to keep earbuds/pods in. These are my first set and I could not be happier. I don’t forget they are there—there is some weight to them— but they do stay in. I personally wouldn’t wear them while doing anything strenuous (gardening, running) but they stay put during regular activity. I am especially impressed with the noise cancellation. The app allows me to adjust the features (volume, transparency mode, play/paise, move forward) and offers a sound test to adjust to my hearing-that made a big difference in sound quality, which I’ll say is excellent.I can’t compare to other pods but have used Beats Solo headphones for years. The noise cancellation of these is far superior. When I speak on phone I’ve been told the difference is tremendous— these are quieting the background noise in a way my Beats don’t. The battery life is excellent. I have yet to run low and I wear them throughout the day, charging at night. The case charges them 2-3 times before needing a Charge. Impressive! My teenage kid uses Apple air pods and says these are just as good and a lot less worrisome as an investment. They ordered their own pair. I also got a set for my 80 year old Mother in Law, she LOVES them. Not tech savvy, she finds them easy to use and often forgets they are in her ears because “they are so comfortable.”All in al, I give these an A+.

I was recently given a set of Poly Voyager Free 60+ earbuds, which retail for about $300. These Anker ones are just better. I'm not an audiophile, I can't really tell the difference in sound quality. The Anker battery life is better, both of the earbuds and the charging case, the ease of use is better (the Poly controls are just weird), and they just connect to both of my phones and work, which the Poly ones sometimes struggle to do. The only advantage to the Poly earbuds is that when you take the earbuds out, the case also connects to your phone, so when you misplace it it's easier to find.

First, the noise cancelation, as well as the transparency, are only mediocre. Sometimes I wouldn't which mode they're in if I couldn't see it on the app. Secondly, while they fit snugly and comfortably for the most part, when on a run, they can ""bounce"" a little bit.

RZ8G7QJR9LDPG,B0B1LVC5VZ,4.0 out of 5 stars (Update) There's a lot to like....(Comparing against Sony WF-1000XM4,Suburbanbushbabe,4,"5/30/24: I just bought TOZO NC9 earbuds as an alternative/substitute to the Sony's which I still have. However, the Sony left earbud stopped working, getting very faint sound. Thankfully, I'm till under warranty and Sony is going to refund me cuz they couldn't replace the model. I'll send back the buds I have and likely get another pair of Sony's during Prime Day sale because I really like the sound; calls come in seamlessly and sound good too. The TOZO NC9 is a pretty good stop gap and definitely sounds better than the A40 which I'm glad I returned. Sony's sound is still stellar though. But the NC9 fit is actually better for ANC. I don't really have to use it a lot, actually.Update 2, 6/14/24. Recently re9laced TOZO NC9 with Anker p40i. I have reviews on both pages.------------Because of the detailed reviews for both Soundcore and Sony WF-1000XM4, after buying the Sony on Prime Day, I just got a pair of these. This review is for music listening, mostly outside walking. I haven't used either for phone calls yet.ANC: Anker ANC is pretty damn good, closer to Sony than you'd think given the price difference. The buds fit well enough that Transparent cuts off sound well too. ANC for in-car driving sounds works slightly better than Sony, and almost blocked out the car radio. Passing cars in the street are near the same for both, but Sony has the edge. This is more important for me as I walk outside. Switching to Sony ANC outside from Transparent is distinctly more noticeable and there's no hissy white noise.Sound: Compared to Anker's more bass heavy ANC and Transparent, its Normal mode is tinny and distinctly different, with worse ambience like it's coming from farther away. Anker ANC and Transparent are more rounded and slightly bass heavy compared to its Normal. ANC and Transparent are quite nice but suffer from seeming bass heavy in comparison. Why is Normal so different? It's quite noticeable to the point that switching from Transparent/ANC to Normal then back makes them sound a bit heavier/muddier (and they're not, really).Sony sound is better, deeper, richer, rounder but still distinct in all modes—ANC, Ambient, Off. It's lovely sound. The only Sony mode I tried and turned right off is Adaptive Sound (doesn't adapt quickly enough, or at all).Anker gives me an audio test and adjusts the sound to my results, very cool.Bud fit: Soundcore is easier to settle in the ear and are softer than the Sony and has more size choices. Sony lets me test the airtightness, which is useful as setting them correctly in the ear canal takes some adjusting, though I am getting better at it after a few wears. The in ear part is stiffer and the buds are a bit larger than Soundcore, so I'm likely to buy replacements for the in ear part. I'm putting up with the learning curve because of the superior sound. But honestly? This awkwardness is what led me to try the Soundcore.Transition from one mode to the other: There is a distinct gap in sound with Soundcore from ANC to other modes. Sony's transition is seamless, except for the background difference.Listening to Radiohead Weird Fishes/Arpeggi which doesn't have high trebles and low low bass, but does have a lot of textural, midrange stuff, I detected a bit more scratchiness in the Soundcore. Lady (Hear me tonight) by Modjo was more comparable with both. But there's definitely a scratchier quality to Soundcore which gets somewhat muted with the deeper base in ANC and Transparent modes.Volume in Soundcore needs to be higher to match WF-1000XM4.Summary: Given the price difference, I was really hoping I could keep the Soundcore instead of the WF-1000XM4 and if the sound quality was closer, I would. But even with Sony's quirky, more awkward fit that needed a learning curve for me to achieve, the WF-1000XM4 gives distinctly more pleasurable listening. And I'm no audiophile, having made do (nowhere totally happy) with Occiam earbuds under $30 until this Sony Prime Day deal showed up. Now I'm spoiled.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2023",AGQSB2UVVFVR2PCSMSWU4QLLUSPA,True,48,Color: Black

They're all about the same, but these truly are different. I only decided to try them because I love these flare speakers I got years and years ago. They are rugged and sound absolutely excellent. I didn't think the earbuds would be as great as they have turned out to be. I'm so happy with them though.","Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2024",AE6BE4DW5TK7462JN4YKXPLR63IA,True,1,Color: Black
R3OP3E4OSAUQYZ,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Unparalleled Serenity and Sound,Christopher Crabbe,5,"I’ve been searching for the perfect pair of wireless earbuds, and these are by far the closest I have ever come. The Soundcore by Anker Space A40 earbuds are nothing short of a revelation in the audio space, and here’s why:I love the app! I have had significant hearing loss in my left ear since early childhood. The ability to isolate and focus on each ear with the hearing test capability has had a profound result. It's like I was missing a range of tones that now come through with vibrance.The Adaptive Active Noise Cancelling is a marvel. It’s not just hype; these earbuds reduce noise so well that even on a busy street or in a noisy airport, the world fades away, and all I’m left with is pure sound.Sound Quality: The Hi-Res sound quality is impeccable. The clarity, the depth, the detail - it’s like I’m hearing my favorite songs for the first time again. The bass is rich without being overpowering, and the highs are crisp and clear.The design is sleek, and the fit is so comfortable that I sometimes forget I’m wearing them. They’re perfect for work meetings, workouts, days at the beach, or trail riding on my bike. These earbuds have exceeded all my expectations. They offer an immersive audio experience, coupled with user-friendly features and a battery life that keeps on giving. If you’re in the market for wireless earbuds that offer exceptional noise cancellation and outstanding sound quality look no further!","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AF7TKVZDOQSQF5D2CMCPO6YM6FIQ,True,2,Color: Blue

So I am adding two stars because of that excellent customer service. The mic issue remains with my set of ear buds, which I initially purchased after reading favorable reviews in trusted sources, such as NY Times Wirecutter.

R1CFHSUM54SW6S,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars A great compromise for air travel and sleeping,Bob Tobias,5,"I bought these thinking they could replace my B00X9KV0HU Bose QC20 earbuds that I use for noise cancellation while I’m on planes and as an alternative to my wonderful Soundcore by Anker, Sleep A10 Bluetooth Sleep Earbuds that I use when I’m trying to fall asleep.These A40 earbuds are not as good at either noise cancellation or sleeping comfort, but it is a good enough compromise that this single set of earbuds is replacing both of these for when I’m traveling. Let’s take a closer look at the specifics…Noise Cancellation: While playing sound, the A40 earbuds get rid of most, but not all, of the outside sound that is blocked by my Bose earbuds. I would say 80% of it. That’s still plenty fine to block engine and small child noises I frequently encounter on flights. I also like that I no longer have to struggle with the long cord of a wired headset.Sleeping Comfort: The key to sleeping comfortably is having a small size so I can lay on my side comfortably. The A40 earbuds are small enough to go unnoticed with a sufficiently soft pillow. However, the A10 earbuds are even smaller and even more comfortable. The A10 earbuds also provide nice sleep-related features like automatically pausing the audio input when I fall asleep so the audiobook I’m listening to doesn’t run on after I’ve stopped listening. But that’s a topic for a different review.General Stuff: I’ll say up front that I’ve come to like Soundcore products, and these earbuds are no exception. They paired with my iPhone immediately. The sound is outstanding. The app provides some nice capabilities, like running a 3-minute test and then customizing the audio equalizer to each ear.Surprising Feature: I’ve always said that I was a sufferer of Hard to Fit Ear (HTFE) syndrome. These things seem to overcome that magically. They stay stuck (comfortably) in my ears for as long as I like.Another Comparison: Comparing these to my AirPod Pros, the fit of the A40 earbuds is more secure, the noise cancellation is MUCH better, and the sound is at least as good. Also, the microphones on the A40s are outstanding. These are among only a few of the earbuds I've used during calls and video conferences where people don't notice any issues with sound quality.All that said, if you're looking for earbuds to use while falling asleep and don't mind spending a bit extra, consider the Soundcore Sleep A10s instead. If, however, you're looking for something that does a great job at being an earbud during the day and can still work at night, then the Space A40s are a great choice.","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2024",AFYGO6C2CKCKBREG72ZNPLSEF4PQ,True,11,Color: Blue

The product allows some customization based on one's own hearing which is tested at least once, if not more, should one wish to optimize performance.

So updating review after that experience. Hoping this device lasts longer than the previous.Original review:I’ve had the soundcore earbuds for a little less than a year. In this time, there is a O-ring around the earbud that has broken off on the left ear that is used to attach the ear tips. Therefore, I cannot attach the ear tips to one of the earbuds rendering it useless.The sound is OKAdditional issues are the application settings and updating the touch settings on the earbuds. You can alter settings between when you have two earbuds in or one.

RNE7IBZAXBSRS,B0B1LVC5VZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Update 11-04-23- at bottom of review,Ben B.,5,"I just got these in the mail today. Dropped them on the wireless charger, got them to full capacity and set them up. Easy enough to pair, had to remove the little stickers over the ear bud charging contact, but then good to pair. The app was easy to set up. Has a familiar hearing test set up to fine tune the EQ for my screwed up hearing. Swapped the really tiny rubber ear bud plugs to a larger size to fit. Then fired up my music app. I was pleasantly surprised! They sound great, much better than expected! Look, people complaining about lack off bass need to realize what they stuck in their ear! For wireless ear buds, these have more than adequate bass. Great mids and highs as well. Happy with the sound quality!!I listen to old (& not so old) rock, some metal, hip hop (before it turned into whatever these kids today call hip hop), mellow ""office music"" all the way to singing bowls for meditation... these seem great right out of the gate.You see I got these during Amazon big deal days for about half off, $50 or so. They were gonna be back ups for my Jabra ear buds. I used to use some old Sony extra bass wired buds that cost 20 bucks 10 years ago ( the sound on those were really good for my eclectic audio preferences) as my back ups. However the new cell phones don't have a 3.5 mm plug, so I needed an extra pair of wireless when the main ones are Recharging. As of today, I can see these being in the mix with the main pair! They really sound good and fit nice too. They are comfortable at this point, but alas; I have yet to wear them for hours on end.I cannot yet verify battery life or any other longer term possible issues. I will for myself and the purpose of this review use the statements provided by Anker as true, until proven wrong. At that point, if it should arise, I will gladly return to this review and update.As of today, I would recommend these, even at full price. Unless something catastrophic occurs, I would get these again. I have alot of Anker stuff, chargers, cables etc. and haven't had any issues with those. Seems they are doing pretty good in the ear bud arena as well!Any issues arise, I will be back to let you all know!!!Thanks for reading my review, hope it helps you.UPDATE: These things have been outperforming my $250+ buds everytime. No regrets in buying these. There are still running strong. The ANC is on par with higher end units. Recently flew for a few hours each way: zero (or no noticeable) latency while watching movies- the actors mouth and words match up great. The ANC does its best with airplane noise, but still let's in some cabin buzz. I used an over the ear set of cheapy headphones with ANC in addition to these beautys and no problems, almost no noise. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great pair of buds; great sound, great battery life- you charge the case with a wireless charger, nice convenience. They don't fall out with snug rubber tips installed.Better than the numerous ""beats"" I've tried and definitely on par and outperforming my high end Jabra.Again, you should not have any issues with these at all and will be thanking that random reviewer so talking you into these!!!!Time will tell if these last, and so will I; I'll be back if anything fails on these.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AH2REP5UKQCJWPCCJGEIBJCK63ZA,True,57,Color: Blue

They fit my ears well no problems without them falling out. I can shake my head violently side to side and they stay put. I use them every day and the battery easily lasts 10 hours. They're small no stems sticking out and comfortable for me to wear all day with no discomfort. Anker has an app so you can customize them for your noise cancellation levels and hearing perfectly. I'm a farmer and work around and operate loud heavy equipment all the time and if the noise is too loud I put a pair of earmuffs over them and you can't hardly hear any outside noise. The charging case is small and fits easily in any pocket. The call quality is great and the volume and sound quality listening to music is also phenomenal.

They reached out to me after they saw I had an issue and wanted to send me another pair of Soundcore Space A40's. They reassured me that my issue was a one off instance with a defective device. I do really like these earbuds as they are very comfortable in my ear which just is NOT the case with most earbuds. I wear my earbuds for about 10-14 hours a day every single day.Less than 5 months ago I purchased these earbuds to be used only in my office. Now the left earbud emits audio at maybe 10% the volume of the right earbud (it's basically non-existent). I don't take the earbuds out of my home and they've only ever been in my ears or their case. It's possible that I dropped that earbud one too many times (I dropped an earbud maybe 5-6 times over these 5 months but I don't know if it was just right, left or both). Suddenly a week ago the left earbud got a little quieter and I started thinking it was just my ear, but today it dropped to nearly inaudible. I do use the earbuds for like 10-14 hours a day every day, so maybe I overused them.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AFUV7ZLSHTQEBYX5CBGQBQ632JDQ,True,0,Color: Blue

I did some research and found that Soundcore has very good reviews. I got my pair of A40 earbuds and I love them so far. The app is intuitive and the installation process went smoothly. The earbuds fit well, the sound quality is great and the microphone is equally great quality. I use the earbuds walking amid heavy traffic in NYC and I feel insulated enough from the outside noise that I hear what’s playing on my phone while being aware of activity around me, which wasn’t possible with both the Apple AirPods and the JPL ones. And I’m happy to report that the Soundcore earbuds weather the windy conditions very well! Whereas I had to remove the JPL earbuds when walking in the wind, due to the level of noise they generated, the Soundcore earbuds work very nicely, almost protective. The tapping controls need a bit of fine-tuning, and I hope the future models will have sorted that out.

I've had this product for about a month and previously reviewed on how difficult it was to keep them in my ears. They slip/pop out easily, even when sitting still but especially while running which is the main time I use them. I had a previous version from this brand that had a rubbery grip at the top that seemed to keep them in place. These don't have that. This week one fell out while running and into an unrecoverable location, so it's a month in and now I only have one.I also find it irritating that I set the sound to ""normal"" rather than ""noise cancelling"" in the app because the noise cancelling has a constant sort of quiet popcorn-popping sound. But it doesn't save the setting so I have to go in and change it frequently.Finally, I have issues with it saying it's connected, but then not playing any sound.

Between myself and immediate family members, we have nearly a dozen different audio devices, including both over the ear and ear bud styles. We also have countless Anker charging cords, charging blocks, and wireless charging devices. They consistently deliver great quality for the money.Purchase Attempt #1? I was hoping that these are just faulty one-offs. They went back immediately.The right bud put out barely any volume, even when the source device is cranked all the way up to maximum.The left ear bud emitted a piercing feedback whine (when source was set to any volume) when touched (like when you put them in your ear, or when tapping the controls). This seemed to be limited to when the buds are in noise cancelling or transparent modes.Purchase attempt #2? Unboxed, set up controls, tested, NO FEEDBACK WHINE! Yay! Right bud producing volume! Yay! Remarkable quality sound and battery life, reasonable noise cancelling for the price ($59).Came back here to write this review, only to find that they were on special for $10 less than I paid for them 2 days ago.Which leads us to Purchase Attempt #3.

RK735S6N8LTI7,B0B8TC6KWF,5.0 out of 5 stars A sound quality focused headset that goes way harder than you'd think it should.,Reina,5,"So, I've owned a lot of wireless headsets over the last few years, and so far, in almost every category, this takes the cake. I didn't expect a headset from Samsung to go this hard, especially with my fondness for Audio Technica and Sennheiser setting my expectations, but here we are. Let's break it down:The first thing I want to state is that I've replaced my last 3 headsets due to their death, and so longevity of this headset will heavily determine whether this review stays 5 starts. I've had it for around two months now, and I expect, generally, to get at least a year out of something like this under pretty heavy use. So far the only headset I've had that met this expectation was the Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless, lasting around a year and a half before one of the buds gave out unexpectedly. After that is was the Audio Technica CKS50TW, out of which I got a grand 3 months, and didn't honestly care to replace under warranty.SOUND QUALITY: My standards for sound quality are pretty high. My desktop audio setup is an Audio Technica ATH-M50x, and while that's not the most impressive headset ever on its own, it's fed by an EVGA NuAudio sound card, and produces some impressive sound with a little bit of EQ tweaking. This headset gets so close to that sound quality that I probably use it more than the M50X now when at my desk. It's better than both the CKS50TW and CX Plus by quite some margin in this regard, and I've seriously come to enjoy the 'dynamic' EQ preset. It is *stunning* quality, in my opinion, for a headset of this price. In case you were wondering, yes it's better than the AirPods, although I've found that *most* headsets from reputable manufacturers in this price range are.BATTERY LIFE: This is perhaps the one aspect of this headset that *doesn't* completely take the cake, but it's still absolutely respectable, and I completely agree with sacrificing battery life for comfort and size, because that is another aspect in which this headset shines. Look- the battery life isn't the *best*, but I typically get 5-7 hours out of it, more if you have noise control turned off, and truthfully, in my room, I don't need it most of the time. There are a lot of headsets out there that do better in this category, but the tradeoff they make is protruding out of the ear to house their larger batteries, and in this case, I think the fact that we're able to get this much battery into an earbud that completely nestles into a fully supported and secure position in the ear is worth it. This is still *plenty* of battery life in my opinion, and the headset charges swiftly, as does the case.NOISE CANCELLING: The ANC and hear-through are both best-in-class as far as my experience goes. This was something where Sennheiser just about made it and Audio Technica kinda fell on their face, but this is the best ANC of any headset I've tried. It does a *fantastic* job of silencing typical office/home background noise like vents, fans, etc. as well as outdoor noise like engines, wind, etc.. One of the other benefits of the completely rounded in-ear design with no protrusion is that they are susceptible to comparatively little wind noise while doing things like cycling, which is my main use case for these. I'm willing to bet that their completely nestled fitment helps with noise cancellation, and may explain why other headsets that protrude further tend to fall flat in this category.There's little else for me to talk about beyond the fitment, and that's something I've said enough about. They're very comfortable, they fit very closely and don't protrude out to catch things like the wind, or my hair. They stay in place exceptionally well, and my overgrown pixie cut even hides them completely because of their low profile. My only complaint is that if the tip of a hair pokes into the pickup for the ANC, it can cause some static until you brush off the hair, a relatively minor gripe that only applies to people within a very narrow range of hair lengths, since longer hair couldn't poke its ends into the pickup, and shorter hair wouldn't reach it.Overall, I sincerely hope this headset lives a long life; I've very much enjoyed it so far, and would like to for as long as possible. The build quality seems decent, and my only concern is dropping the buds on a hard surface or wax ingress, but I think both the headset and tips are well-designed to prevent wax ingress, and dropping things is sort of an end user problem in this case that only particularly butterfingered individuals like myself really struggle with, so we'll see how this goes.","Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2023",AGUL35FDKA6JPXM47JULQSOP2UAQ,True,297,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2
ROAZB54HZ5QT1,B0B8TC6KWF,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Earbuds!,Malissa Atkins,5,"To begin my review, I want to say right off the bat, these earbuds are phenomenal. This is the third pair we have in our household because they are so amazing. We have been upgrading from the previous model. They provide great sound quality, the touch panels have a good level of sensitivity, and they are high quality.I will start with the good things and add the bad as I go. Not really all that bad, just personal preferences. They come with 3 sets of ear tips to adjust the fit. I do find when moving around, I need to adjust them in my ears. Being water resistant, when I am caught in the rain, I feel confident these won’t be damaged. I don’t think a person who jogs or walks for exercise will find them to stay in your ear. For me, I use them when I need to take a call, or I am in an area I want to hear my phone without disrupting people around me. Be sure to use the Wearables app to test your fit to ensure you have the right tip. As with all tips for earbuds, it can be challenging to switch these out. Even with the fit not being perfect, they are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.As for the sensitivity, I find the Buds 2 Pro are reasonably sensitive. The previous model was challenging. I do like how they have adjusted it. I do find the customization to be limited. There is only one touch control with limited customization. The touch-and-hold command is set to volume up on the right, and volume down on the left. I like this, as I am mostly adjusting volume. I don’t like that I can’t mix this up. I would like to have one control the volume and let the other do something else. You can integrate them into your voice command apps like assistants. I use mine with YouTube music. I can use a single tap to pause or two taps to go to the next song. This also works with phone calls. Two taps to answer the call or three taps to decline the call.I do think the battery performance is acceptable. I can get around 4.5 hours without charging them again. I like the Wireless PowerShare function. I use my phone to charge them when in a bind. If you are curious about the noise cancelling, I think these earbuds perform well. I can hear people around me, but it cancels it out enough for me to be able to hear things on my device. I like this mostly because I can still be aware of my surroundings. This leads me into the actual audio quality. You can toggle on the ambient sound mode and it removes the distortions with your voice.With everything good, there are always some cons. I think it is worth mentioning the rubberized case needs a revamp. It looks great as a rounded square shape. It sits flat and feels sturdy. The downside is that the rubberized matte scratches super easy. It also collects lint like you wouldn’t believe. I do like the grippy feel of case when I pick them up. Another thing I do notice is the magnet on the lid, which does keep it secure. The magnets inside, another manufacturing flaw. They don’t follow the guides of the cutout, so I shift them into place. Didn’t have this issue with the previous model. I hope they consider that for 3 Pro that is rumored to coming this year.I would highly suggest these earbuds, they are well worth the price. I also want to mention this seller was great to deal with. The packaging was perfect and arrived within the delivery time. 5 stars all the way around.","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2024",AFE2FWMC7UY7FW54DZM6HDDMURUA,True,13,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2
R3H8R7BRAON8JT,B0B8TC6KWF,"4.0 out of 5 stars Such great sound, painful design for smaller ears",Tee,4,"This earbuds are absolutely incredible for the cost differential; pay a bit more, massive upgrade in sound quality.I have nice speakers and decent wired over-ears at home, but with my partner and I both working hybrid schedules, I usually listen to music and podcasts with my earbuds in. I always told myself I'd just use my speakers, but being able to have just one bud in so I'm not walking around the house like an oblivious wad is irresistible. The wireless convenience calls to me. However, I've never been so much of a noise geek that I was going to pay for nicer wireless earbuds. Still, the reality of the situation is that I use earbuds an overwhelming amount of the time.Because of this, it crept up slowly that I've hardly been listening to music. I had the older, non-pro Galaxy buds 2 for years- replaced once with the same model to have spares without an upgrade- and while I loved the look and feel of them and they were serviceable, the sound was not great. Audio for calls was sometimes terrible, and I was unintelligible half the time. They fell out of my ears if I was running, although not so abruptly I couldn't fix the positioning and prevent them from popping out with a free hnad. Ultimately, none of these issues were enough to make me want to upgrade to the bulkier, more expensive Pro earbuds. Still, when my older headphones started to get finicky again, I eventually bit the bullet, thinking I might just get more of the non-Pros anyway.It was amazing. These are the first earbuds I've owned where the sound quality was worth even listening to music on, and that's when I realized immediately how much more I'd be listening to. They have great, rich, dynamic sound. I didn't love the look of the exterior speaker on the larger buds, but I 180'd as soon as I heard the results- obviously, it was worth it.They were so much bigger that they looked a little goofy in my ears. Not a big deal, worth the effect and good noise that came out of them. I've been very excited.Unfortunately, I like having background noise running for much of my workday, and my partner and I often have different listening priorities. This is a problem because I quickly realized that, if worn for an extended period of time, these are physically painful on the cartilage of my ears. No matter how I positioned them, if I wore them for a few hours, my ears (specifically, whatever you call the curve of cartilage above the lobe) get sore to the touch for hours or days. Seemingly, I can get about an hour of listening out of these a day. That's a downer, as I didn't buy them thinking I'd have to restrict my use of them as aggressively as my parents tried to limit my screen time in the early 2000s.On the plus side, they still sound great, and my old headphones ended their time on the fritz, so I've just gone back to them. I can wear these around the house where my options are ample, and in theory, I'll probably still use them. I'm holding out secret hope that I can slowly damage the cartilage of my ears enough that I can wear them longer, but for now, I'm punished with seriously tender ear-tissue that lasts for days and bothers me even if I switch headphones or earbuds.Long and short of it, they sound great. They're massively worth the money if you're considering an upgrade from the regular galaxy 2's for the pro's (although I still prefer the smaller, simpler look aesthetically). They even stopped falling out of my ears when I'm on a run with this new design. Unfortunately, be cautious if your ear-holes aren't on the larger side and you aren't willing to gauge a weird part of your ears as part of the bargain.","Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2023",AEB7F6YYWDSPBH5LZEUMQTRSLMNA,True,55,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2

As far as I can tell, they are the international version without a US warranty, but seem to be otherwise exactly the same. I am OK with this since they are way cheaper and I have Amazon’s 30 days of free returns to test it out.Compared to Sony’s top WF-1000XM5 buds:PRO+ Much, much cheaper.+ ANC is excellent and often more effective than Sony.+ Sound is great for both Samsung and Sony. Samsung has 10mm woofer + 5.3mm tweeter.+ I have large ears and the Buds2 Pro (large tips) are just as secure and comfortable.CON- Battery life is OK, but worse than Sony.- The normal sound profile is fine, but it does not have any fine tuning of the equalizer like Sony.- Bud touch controls do not have as much flexibility as Sony.- Samsung’s Wear app does not have as many options as Sony’s.- Doesn’t have Sony’s option: Hold the right earbud to switch to Ambient and mute the music.- Annoyingly, pulling one Samsung earbud out does not mute the music in the other bud.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AE4WZKQZZPF6H7HFIKCK35ZMRYMQ,True,27,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2
R2V1KQMXWS3SDX,B0B8TC6KWF,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for Samsung users,Angelina,5,"*Used with S23 Ultra*I've used this for over a year and because I don't own a pair of wireless headphones, these are my daily drivers. At first I was unused to the way these fit in my ears, but after I've found the sweet spot, very rarely would they move from their place. They haven't fallen out of my ears, but when I'm exercising and my head is not in a vertical plane, these will come loose. My ears must be asymmetrical because this typically happens with my left ear. These are still the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn (especially compared to AirPods Pros, those don't even stay in) but again, everyone's ears are different.Back when I used them in classes, these earbuds lasted me around 5 days (~3hrs/day) before I recharged them through the cycle--however I mostly used one earbud at a time so your mileage may vary. The ambient mode allows decent enough passthrough noise, but depending on how loud my music is I may struggle to hear them--I prefer to have one ear open and one ear with ambient mode. Noise cancelling does well with lower frequencies, but any high pitched noises will make it through. I used to use a pair of Blackweb TWS so by comparison the sound quality is miles better. If you're using a regular Spotify (or music streaming equivalent) account, honestly no higher than 128kbps is going to make much of a difference even with better gear.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AFC7CQXYODTC6O57DKI5DLOALVVA,True,2,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2
R2PV04E5LFNAHR,B0B8TC6KWF,5.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional Audio Quality and Seamless Integration - Worth Every Penny!,Michael Greene,5,"I recently purchased the Samsung BudPro 2 earbuds, and I must say, they've completely surpassed my expectations! Initially, I was a bit hesitant (wondering if I'm getting the correct set) due to the price of $110, considering they are well worth the full retail price of $229, but after experiencing their performance firsthand, any doubts I had were quickly dispelled.The audio quality is simply stellar. As someone who prioritizes sound clarity, the BudPro 2s deliver on all fronts. The sound is sharp, clear, and maintains a rich texture that enhances any genre of music I throw at them. Whether I'm listening to the intricate details of a classical piece or the bass-heavy drops of an electronic track, these earbuds capture it all with precision.What truly stands out to me, aside from their audio prowess, is the comfort and minimal visibility they offer when worn. They fit snugly in my ears without causing any discomfort, making them perfect for long listening sessions. Additionally, their low-profile design means they hardly stick out, which I greatly appreciate.The touch controls are a game-changer. The ability to answer or reject calls, play/pause music, skip to the next track, or repeat a song with a simple tap on the earpiece is incredibly convenient. This feature has made my listening experience not just enjoyable but effortlessly intuitive.For those who are active, rest assured these buds stay firmly in place during runs and workouts. I've put them through the a test.Lastly, the seamless integration with Samsung devices is remarkable. Pairing with my Samsung phone through the Wearable app was a breeze, and the automatic sync with my Galaxy watch was the cherry on top, making for a cohesive and streamlined user experience.In conclusion, the Samsung BudPro 2 earbuds are a fantastic investment for anyone who values exceptional sound quality, convenience, and seamless device integration. They've exceeded my expectations in every way and have become an essential part of my daily routine.

R1NJ5K3ET7L070,B0B8TC6KWF,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and features but battery life is horrible,Karma Came,4,"The media could not be loaded. Awesome experience coming out of the box and immediately intergrating with the app and my phone.It took awhile to get used to how to use the touch controls but It's good once I got it.They have to be in your ear properly for the noise cancellation and ambience to sound the way its supposed to.They fit good and don't fall out.I wore them with Anc, voice recognition and touch on and they went from 100%-35% in 3 hrs so I'm guessing they'll last 4.5hrs with most features on.This is a major issue im surprised no one on the development team stopped to say hey guys battery life is really important lets increase it before releasing them.idk what they were thinking. Probably that most ppl only wear them one at a time but Im one who likes both in especially since they have voice recognition.Even with 1 in, I want the battery to last way longer.They just rounded up to 5hrs (20% an hr if your lucky).Other then that I love the design, the sound quality is great,and the voice recognition is my favorite. It works perfect for when I'm at work and someone starts talking.I don't have to take my earbuds out to hear them.Unfortunetly that's part of what burns the battery and I'll be taking them out to charge them all throughout the day anyway.Iam impressed with the speed of charge but its annoying.Im coming from a $30 pair of earbuds that sounded fine had a few features including waterproof and the battery lasted for weeks with wearing them all day and keeping them in the case in-between. If the battery on these lasted like that, these would be a 10 star for me. I'm constantly checking the battery and adjusting settings to try to preserve it.I just want to pop them in with the features I like, forget about the battery and be at ease. I'm glad I got these now instead of when they first dropped...the nerve to charge almost $300 and you can't even get a full day's play or a good night sleep with some sleep music flowing through them on.id give them another .5 star for being transparent about the battery.I also have myself to blame for not realizing how my experience would be constantly charging them. It's like cool these are amazing but wait do I want to use all the features I need or have longer battery life.i Dont wanna choose! I won't both 😌Also no complaints on call quality and I love the feature where I can hear myself during calls.It helps me know how loud I'm talking instead of wondering if I'm talking too loud or quiet while there in.Update after using a couple of weeksThe features of the headphones outshine the battery life...but both is still preferred.They do go to full charge pretty fast in the case especially if you have the charger pluged in as well.The sound quality is great and I still love the voice detection,noise canceling and Ambient sound...My only issue is every now and then I hear a high pitched sound when adjusting the right ear bud and the case gets easily soiled if your wearing lotion or just ate a bag of chips or something.So I've upped my rating to 4 stars for those reasons.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AGJCZRZELMPPOKJOZFJ7ILRMZJDA,True,5,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2
R4425XFAEA9C8,B0B8TC6KWF,4.0 out of 5 stars Not the best ANC,Meg,4,"These are a replacement for my beloved Galaxy buds plus which saw 3 years of daily, heavy use. I was sad when they died and didn't have high hopes of these living up. Upon setup, I was upset to find that, although the setup wizard has a feature to check for optimum fit, I needed a different tip and no additional tips had been included. I noticed the sound quality was the best I'd ever heard in just a few seconds though, beating the pants off my previous buds and everything else about them was so sleek and cute that I didn't want to send them back for an exchange. So I used the handy ""contact the manufacturer"" info on the Amazon page and reached out via chat support, new tips were on their way to me within 15 minutes. Great post purchase support from both Amazon and Samsung there.So why only 4 stars? Similar to my previous pair of Samsung buds, the ANC leaves much to be desired. Still cancels out some of the noise, but not even as much as my cheap Tozo buds with which I interchange use.Still, for home use when I want to stay aware of my surroundings but not have ambient noise on, they're great. The sound quality is truly good, the interface exactly the same as my old buds, and they are sleek and visually pleasing.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2024",AGQ7FBIXEGQZX4CNSWWSTDGMQT5Q,True,0,Color: VioletSize: Buds Pro 2

I've only ever had cheap bluetooth earbuds and these are absolutely insane. The noise canceling isn't perfect but I work in a place with constant loud noise and these do a great job at dampening that. The touch controls are pretty seamless, my hands are dirty pretty much all day and a quick tap or hold either my wrist either pauses or changes the noise canceling to ambient sound and vise versa. The ambient sound works great but there is some white noise even in a quiet area. I have zero complaints about sound I usually have them pretty low and they still sound great. I suggest using bass mode, there isn't much bass but it helps. The battery is as advertised I put then in at 6 for work and around 11:10-11:15 they're dead each day so the 5 hours they claim is true. They charge really quickly and 1 earbud takes 20% from the case so two is 40%.

Updating my review from a 3 star to 5 star. To address my previous point, I don't miss the multipoint pairing at all. I thought it was convenient, but with these buds I can easily change audio sources and my meetings on my laptop don't get interrupted when I get a phone call. I've since learned that in order to improve call audio, I need to avoid adjusting the buds when in my ear. When the audio is bad, I just have to remove and reseat the earbuds. Since learning this trick, I don't get any complaints when I take calls.In addition to the above points, these buds are sooo much more portable than my QC35s. I just keep my QC35s at my desk at home. I've gotten into one bag travel and the extra space saved with this buds is worth it. The noise cancellation on planes is pretty good. I don't miss carrying around my headphones at all.Original review:Bought these as a portable replacement for my bose QC35. I like the headphones so far. Two issues are the call quality and the lack of multipoint pairing, which I never faced with the 5 years old QC35.In every phone call I've had I've been told that I cannot be heard and have to switch audio from the buds to my phone. Also the lack of multipoint pairing is a huge pain; having to reconnect when I switch devices is much more inconvenient than I would have thought with my old headphones.I will keep the headphones because I think it still works for my usecase, listening to my phone during commute or travel. I have been able to easily connect to my laptop, desktop, and Nintendo Switch, but the lack of multipoint pairing means I probably won't switch between devices often.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AHJXLXXIXCZCLZFM4SOXA5HM5XEA,True,0,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2

I cannot recommend Galaxy Buds 2 Pro enough.The sound is remarkable, simply put.Turning on the 360 audio feature on them changes everything, I don't even know how it's possible to feel like the sound is coming from everywhere besides the things sitting in your ears.The active noice canceling is shocking, it's substantially better than just a generation ago in the buds 2. My window is right next to a main road in my town, and I can sit right in front of it, watching cars go by 15 feet away, without anything playing in the earbuds, and not hear the cars at all. Blows my mind.Generally buds with wingtips fit best in my ears, and they give me more confidence wearing them in active conditions, jogging, biking, cleaning, etc. The Buds 2 never stayed in my ears very well, constant adjustments, the Buds Pro were even worse, and produced unbearable pain in my ears due to their size, geometry, and weight. I was frankly expecting a similar outcome with these Buds 2 Pro, I was instead very surprised to find out that they fit and stay in my ears better than even the Buds FE and other wingtipped buds. I can wear them indefinitely without discomfort, and rarely have to adjust their position in my ears. I do not know how they pulled this off. They are noticeably lighter than previous buds, this surely plays a role. (I understand the fitment will vary by individual)Battery life is also perfectly sufficient for most people's listening habits, I would imagine. The old Buds+ and their 11+ hours have spoiled me though, and leave me wanting more with all the Buds I've had since, but, I can't really complain with these specifically, ~6 hours is a fine tradeoff if it means lighter buds with better drivers.I'm not an audiophile, I can't tell you why these sound great, but they do, that is certain.HIGHLY recommend.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2024",AH2FUG5JDO4QKFXM73QONCMDIBKA,True,9,Color: WhiteSize: Buds Pro 2

R14JXPVI1PZSR4,B0B8TC6KWF,3.0 out of 5 stars These aren't mind-blowing but I don't regret buying,Syd mouse,3,"People make videos to convey what they feel is very important about a particular subject. I watched alot of reviews about these and made the decision to buy them expecting them to atleast be good considering people have a tough time deciding between these, bose and apple. I have the S23 Ultra so I wanted to stay within the same eco system to get the best quality possible.They are made very well. I'm not going to ignore that. And overall sound is great. But they are small and so the sound is small. There's no sound stage. It's not possible in this form factor. This is closer to a reference sound quality.Noise canceling is perfectly fine. I'm a truck driver and it blocks out the sound of an idling 13 liter diesel perfectly.Battery life is great. They go into the case using them normally more than enough I've never had dead batteries. If you need ear buds 24 hrs a day just buy 2 pairs.I'm not going to rate them based on other ear buds ignoring over ear options. That's not how I work.The comfort, fit and ability to stay in is top notch. I prefer them over the offerings from Apple. It's easy to forget they are there.The pass through audio is really nice to have as an option but with all headphones don't expect them yo disappear when you disable anc. It works, it's good enough to use instead of pulling them out to hold a conversation because it's faster.Was it worth 200+? No. None of them are. Not bose not apple not sennheiser not samsung. Was it worth 110$ absolutely... are they better than a 50$ pair? Yes... just on how they fit alone. How they feel in your ears for more than 30 minutes etc.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AEMCUCJ7LZSH72X2UIFP2RRFQL5A,True,0,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2

The battery on these are not great, they'd probably die within 6 hours, which is enough for most people but I'm an earbud in my ear all day type of person.The fit isn't great either, I've tried all of the sizes of tips and I always feel like the buds aren't in my ears enough and like they could fall out which makes me constantly try to shove them into my ears for a better fit.I like the touch sensor on these better than raycon (most of the time I would have to use my whole palm to slap the earbud in my ear to hit the sensor) the downside to this sensor is that if you have long hair and if your hair is wet it will activate the sensor. Which is a bit annoying.The noise canceling and the ambient feature are great, sometimes ambient modes on other headphone sound weird or there's a shhhing or crackling noise, but these cound clear.I love the case, it's sleek and easy to open.I'm no audiophile but I think the sound quality is very good.Moral of the story, I wish I had gotten another pair of raycons, but I'm not super mad at them.

I now have a pair for each of 3 devices -- 2 laptops and 1 smartphone, plus one backup. This allows me to easily switch between devices or even listen to more than one at a time. What is the catch?To keep them straight, I biry them in different colors and slightly different models. Most recently, I choose Buds 2 Pro in all white (case and buds). For some reason, the surface of the case and buds is VERY SLIPPERY. This was surprising, since the black version of the same buds is just the opposite -- a rubbery exterial adds friction and reduces slippage. Not sonthe white. To make matters worse, when you inevitably drop the case, even from a fairly low height, the buds will pop out and roll or bounce a surprising distance.I've been lucky so far, but I dread the day when I happen to be standing near a storm drain or train platform or body of water and then...","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AHWDT5J7TWQVULC4DZQUXXYZFBXA,True,0,Color: WhiteSize: Buds Pro 2

With Samsung, you get a few basic customization options but that's pretty much it.One noticeable issue is that when you go to adjust the earbuds there is really no way, realistically, to avoid triggering one of the earbuds touch controls. So, in other words, you go to make a quick adjustment and you either turn the volume up or down, you activate Spotify, are you skipped to the next track. That can get pretty annoying. Other than that these really do sound fantastic and are super comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States March 25, 2024",AH37M3O7EXQF34MBS2FF6WLIQ2GQ,True,1,Color: WhiteSize: Buds Pro 2

R31AJC8CCE2J3P,B0B8TC6KWF,5.0 out of 5 stars A total win! Purple Galaxy buds VS Olivia Rodrigo Sony Linkbuds,Rylee,5,"After a month of using these, they might as well be a part of my body. I'm always wearing at least one. They are so comfortable, sometimes I forget I'm wearing them. I use them at work all the time when I have to be on the phone, I even sleep in them. They NEVER fall out, and that was my biggest issue with headphones before. Wish I could give 200 stars.ove these so far, due to my prior mistake of purchasing the Olivia Rodrigo Sony Linkbuds S, I have included a comparative review below.So, I originally ordered the sony linkbuds S Olivia Rodrigo edition. I had read several reviews that boasted about it's sound quality and that the size of the buds were better for small ears. Let me tell ya, thus far, these eat the sony ones ALIVE. MUCH better sound quality, while the buds themselves are bigger, the case and overall product size is much more compact. I actually had to return the Sony ones because they fell apart within a month of extremely light use! They also has no wireless charging! I will say, I preferred the size of the buds themselves and I liked the fact that they came with additional earbud tips, which really helped with sizing issues. However, end the end I'm very happy they fell apart or I would have never returned them and got these for HALF the price. Sony customer support was also useless, I actually just wanted them fixed or even just to BUY a replacement piece. I could apparently do neither. Amazon quickly resolved it and let me return them, I then ordered these for HALF the price. So, if you are torn between the OR linkbud S and these bc you want a cute aestetic earbud? Do not be fooled!!! The Samsung buds beat them in sound, durability, post purchase support AND price. Plus, even though the Linkbuds may be more decorative, they have so many cute accessories for the Galaxy buds while the linkbuds have like...2 cases. Don't be tempted like I was! Make the right choice!!! I will obviously update in about a month, as that is when I had the biggest issue with the linkbuds, stay tuned.","Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2024",AFN5VECLDWXWY6DMWG3NPDF5UWEQ,True,27,Color: VioletSize: Buds Pro 2

I returned it because I didn't like them as much. This time I got an international version. Wish I kept the first ones but it's okay.I bought and tried a bunch of other earbuds. Apple kind, Samsung, soundcore. But in the end nothing is perfect but for having a Samsung phone. These work well and have the most features that I care about.I love the double tap anywhere near my ear to change volume. Of course you have to use both earbuds to get full control of volume up and down, not a big deal to me. I also love the chat to speak, wheres if I start talking it lowers the volume and pipes in outside noise to the earbuds so I don't have to take them off or pause.ANC is either great of just above average. Everybody has different ears. So you'd have to try and find out. Same thing with sound. To me these are a lot better then others I tried. I will say the buds FE do a very well job of competing with these for half the price. But loses features to hit that price.Battery life is not bad but not great. But I understand, it has many features that eat into the battery. I've been running them for about 1 hours with 82% so that actually will hit the advertised 5 hours. Id probably get more battery life with ANC and chat to speak off.ANC has been good. But some updates have made them add a low white noise to them. Which is only noticeable when no music is playing. It doesn't bother me.In the end I love these, but these are just a place holder until the buds3 Pro come out.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2024",AFNG2DBQIXX3YXCTASPCJDKRYBSA,True,2,Color: WhiteSize: Buds Pro 2

R2TPPWPFS3VJLN,B0B8TC6KWF,4.0 out of 5 stars Will not pair with Galaxy Note 9,Ron Christian,4,"Just a warning, these buds will not pair with a Galaxy Note 9. The phone sees a serial number (not the name of the product) and fails to pair.The buds will pair with a Galaxy 6 classic watch, but since neither the buds nor the watch come with documentation, it took some sleuthing to find a solution that worked. As so:The buds go into pairing mode when the case is opened. Best practices is to leave the case on a charger for an hour or so before first trying to pair.From the watch, go to setup -> connections -> bluetooth. Turn on bluetooth if not on.Open the case for the earbuds. This starts the pairing process.When the buds name come up in the watch display, touch it. You should be paired at that point.Save yourself some trouble and put the Galaxy Buds Pro app in the Tiles screen so you can find it easily.Go to the Galaxy Buds Pro app.Note that you need to have the buds firmly seated in your ears for the noise cancellation to work. Like, really firmly.You'll notice when the buds are seated firmly enough because the ""noise cancellation"" button will no longer be greyed out and the sound quality improves dramatically.One final note: These buds are only as good as the source. If the music source is highly compressed, the buds will sound tinny. With a good music source and with the buds seated properly they seem decent.There doesn't seem to be any kind of mixer app on the watch, so you can't do things like bring up the bass or fix the treble. I'd love to be wrong on this but I have not found any way to change the mixture. A lot of the music on the Amazon Music app sounds tinny as a result. If that's your experience, it's not you.","Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2023",AFMV3U7WAXNEKJISTV57UXNS26OQ,True,2,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2

R1N98EJQUA8TUK,B0B8TC6KWF,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing headphones - great audio quality,kris,5,"I have always used cheaper Bluetooth wireless headsets for my phone, but on a recent trip to Utah I decided to splurge. I don't know why I didn't sooner. These are super comfortable in the ears and the noise canceling is absolutely amazing. I would compare it to my Bose headphones that I wear when I'm at home in the quality of the noise canceling. If you pair them with a Samsung phone, you get even more additional features that are just mind blowing compared to your cheap Bluetooth headsets.So I leave it in this if you have a Samsung Galaxy Device absolutely think about spending the money and buying a set of fees you will not regret it. Only one complaint I have, the flip up lid of the charger case comes open very easily, every now and then you'll lose the headphones in your pocket or if you drop the case they will go flying. They have even bounced off into puddles and into a toilet at one point. Drive them off quickly and both of them have still worked for month since I got them. Other than the case I have nothing bad to say about these things can't wait to see the next iteration.","Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2024",AFOPBZLNIR54AQBODJYEE7DDEMGQ,True,1,Color: WhiteSize: Buds Pro 2

They have excellent sound and the active noise cancelling and voice detect features have been extremely valuable for return to office. They work perfectly to block out the inane dronings of my coworkers, but allow for me to respond to inquiries without having to physically pause my podcast or music. The fit is perfect; not too large or small. They don't slip when I'm walking quickly or moving my head around a lot. The battery life so far seems pretty good, but I've only ever really used them for 6-8 hours at a time.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2024",AHQCSNFXNLTOSB6G34GDNCGO7IJA,True,1,Color: VioletSize: Buds Pro 2

Minor, simple to learn the right way to toss them in, but for a while, if you had the old ones, the change will slightly annoy. other than that, I have no issue. They are a little (slightly) annoying to pair for the very first time. After that, they hook back up easily and quickly, but the first time you have to touch them in the case in a certain way.

The ones that came with the earbuds were too big and caused the earbuds to come loose and fall out of my ears more than once every time I wore them. The Framonics cushioned small ones fit really well. For the price they should have included more than one size.As for the ease of use the ""Wear"" app really helps as a visual interface to set the buds up.

R28P4GIXMSY1XJ,B0B8TC6KWF,"3.0 out of 5 stars Poor noise cancellation, touch controls are too sensitive",kupical,3,"I wanted to like these but ended up returning them. I got these to replace my broken beats studio buds, but the noise cancellation on these was terrible. At the airport it was a noticable decrease in noise cancellation, which is the main place where I reeeally need the quiet. Voices, clanging, luggage rolling, everything sounded tinny and could be easily heard over my music. I need that feeling of flicking a switch and the world fades, these don't accomplish that at all.The other big issue was that I ended up turning the touch controls off since everytime I wanted to adjust these in my ear it would pause/skip/change listening mode. There's no obvious place for touch, seems like the whole earbud is touch sensitive. Huge pain to have the touch controls be basically unusable.Replaced these with Bose QC II earbuds for $90 more (on sale at the moment). These solved both problems in a big way, though I haven't used them extensively yet.Sound quality was good, but if noise cancellation is important, at this price point I'd go with the beats studio buds, or upgrade to one of the ANC leaders - Apple, Sony, or Bose.","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AH7M52CURMGA4F3GPCQLBPRAPKPA,True,0,Color: GraySize: Buds Pro 2
